The gods of theKaaba have their needs,their upkeeps.Who is that man who stood there,who looked into my soul?Carry me away from here.Why must Muhammad come down here?Why don't you stop him?He is your nephew.Maybe he will change.Change?He is 40 years old.It's unnatural...with a rich wife, he couldafford the best of Mecca.Yet he chooses to sit shivering in a cave.It is unnatural!For a man who dares torisk the anger of Al-Uzza,who keeps our health.Manat, the god of our prosperity.Allat, the god of ourfamily and tribes.and Hubal...Hubal, who starts our caravansand predicts our fate.To challenge the gods within earshotof the gods is dangerous.Unreasonable.Rebellious, blasphemous.Yes, I'm afraid Muhammadwill harm himself.I am always sadwhen the great fair is over.I might not see the next one.Abu Talib! Abu Talib!Catch your breath, Zaid!Has Muhammad come downfrom Mount Hira yet?He's been up there three days.No, no, I haven't seen him.Khadijah hoped he might havecome to you on his way home.Then he's still up there.Three days.I'm afraid for him on the mountain,because...I don't know what it means.Men see the world too wellfrom a mountain.Muhammad! Read!In the name of thy Lord who createdman from His sensitive drop of blood.Who teaches man what he knows not.Read!He's still trembling under the blanket...but he has spoken.Zaid! What happened tomy nephew on the mountain?He was alone, in the cave.Suddenly, an angel came in to him.The angel said: Read!Muhammad replied: I can not read.The angel commanded again: Read!In the name of thy Lord,who created man fromHis sensitive drop of blood,who teaches man what he knows not.Read!Who knows if it was Gabriel?It could have been a dream.When Muhammad was coming fromthe mountain, he saw Gabriel plainly.In the shape of a manstanding on the horizon.Wherever he looked,upon every turn ofhis head he saw him.And Gabriel said to him again,I am Gabriel...and you Muhammad,are the Messenger of God.Who has he told about this?His wife,and Ali,and, his friend Abu Bakr.And you?I am his adopted son.Be careful to whom you talk.Tell him his uncle who protected himwhen he was a child, will protect him still.After all...they say the God of Mosesspoke to him out of a burning bush.If you do not restrainyour nephew then we will.He's dividing the city,heart against house.He's dividing the generationschild against parent.The young are listening to him.He attracts the young.We are Arabs,we obey our fathers.Our children cannot be our teachers.How can we accept that the manwe met in the street yesterdaycan be some God's Prophet today?Dead bones can live again, he saysbecause He who created mancan also make man returnfrom the dead, he says!The Gods might leave us andgive their benefits to another city.Tell him...we will give himauthority, position,and keys to the Kaaba,and money, what money he wants.Tell him, we will givehim anything he wants.Muhammad, spare yourself...and me.Do not put a greater burden onan old man that he can bear.In your childhood, you were in my arms.I cannot now see you hurt.If you refuse them...they will hurt you.He said this to me:Were they to put the sun in myright hand and the moon in my left,I would not renounce my message,which is from God.When I am dead,you may do as you please,but whilst I'm alive,you will obey your father!Why did you hurt our father?If I were drunk every dayand played dice every night,you'd call it high spirits!You will be more mybrother than you are now!You are all my children.I've given you everything I could,but it seems not to be enough.Muhammad gives me more,he give all the world more.Get him out of here, father!It's not Waleed or me,it's our father.You tortured him.Wait Hudayfa, wait!How can they sayit's an invention, Musab,when it isn't new?In Mecca, it's new.Yet, God has said it all before...to Noah, Moses, Jesusto all the Prophets,but people changed it,turned it, forgot it.Now God said it to Muhammad again...and it is new again.What is it?It's Jafar.What have you brought with you?The very word of God.When the sun is overthrown.When the stars fall.When the mountains vanish.When the camels big withyoung are abandoned.When the wild beasts are herded together.When the seas rise.When the souls are sorted.When the female infantwho is buried alive,asks for what crime she was killed.When the books are opened.When the sky is torn away,then...every soul...will know what it has done.Were you there, Jafarwhen God gave him these words?Dawn is coming up.Ammar, you first,then you Jaafar.Ammar!You kept your mother awakeall night with worry.I'm sorry father.Where were you?Have you been with Muhammad again?What will happen now?Forgive him, it wasmy fault, I did it.That God has helped us all our lives.But it fell...it could not even help itself.What talk have you been listening to?The real god is unseen.He's not made of clay.Ammar, we see the godsin the Kaaba every day.I'm afraid for you.You're listening to peoplewho will hurt you.I'm listening to Muhammad, mother.Muhammad is generous, yes.He gives, he shares,he'll pass no man without a smile,but he is spreading dangerous ideas.Dangerous ideas,that no man should start?That the rich should not afloat the poor?The strong should not oppress the weak?Are these dangerous ideas?Girls should not be forced into marriage,but be able to choose or refuse.By only tonight, he said;Stop the burial of new-born girls.I was fortunate, alwaysfortunate with your mother.Yes, but you know that you and Inearly never met, Yasser.And you were nearly never born.I was to be buried,like my two sisters,but my father couldn't do it.He couldn't do it the third time.When the second girl was being...when my father was putting sand over her,she took hold of his finger,the way a baby does.He told my mother afterwards,that it was a minute...before the tender little grip eased...and he dared take away his hand.When I was born,my father ran out of the housescreaming that he couldn't do it again,that he could never do it again.Sumayyah, it is the custom.But it's wrong.The gods that let suchthings be are no gods.I promised to go to Muhammad'shouse mama, we pray there.Yes! He is a good man.Yes...yes, you go.Two men are following him.Read? Muhammad canneither write nor read.But he can speak.What did you say?He can speak?Well, so can you so now,you speak up young man.What does Muhammad say, umm?They are God's words, not his.Which god's?What words?A speaking god?Your Muhammadspeaks only to himself.When God reveals Hismessage to Muhammad,he remembers every wordthen he tells it to those who can write...this is the Quran.Muhammad has starvedhimself into dreams.He hides under a blanketwith his eyes shut.His eyes are shutbut his heart is open.You! Kick him for his cleverness.There is no purpose in that.Doesn't Muhammad realize, welive by giving housing to the gods?We own the Kaaba.Every year, the tribes ofArabia come here to Meccato pray and to buy from us.Now, were we to replace300 Gods with just one?Whom we cannot even see, who issupposed to be in Taif and Medina,here in my house,in Jerusalem, on the moon?Where would Mecca be then?The gods are both ourworship and our revenue.You cannot buy and sell God.Young man, you areclose to the whip.Ammar, be sensible boy.I have a question.Muhammad teaches you,a slave is equal to his master.This black Bilal, who Ipaid money for...equal to me?Yes Muhammad says...before God, all men are asequal as the teeth of a comb.This is a very pleasant ideato slaves and beggars.It gives them pretensions.Bilal!Teach this man the differencebetween the Lord of Mecca and a slave.Take that whip.Lash his face, toteach his mouth a lesson.Whip him!Whip him!Cut him!Whip him!Do it Bilal!Obey them!They will kill you!See what anarchy they bring!They've even infected our slaves!If you're human enoughto have gods......remember!They are the gods of your owner!I bought your humanity Bilalwhen I bought you.You will be corrected!One, one God.There is only one God!Who is stronger now?Your masteror this one god of yours?One God.There is only one God.Bring the stones!One God.One......one God.Crush him!Break him!Have you finished with him?There is only one God!- One God!- You could swear the slave was preaching!- One God!- Lord Umaya!Abu Bakr will pay a \n",
      "dinars for this slave.Wait now!It's against our social orderto sell a slave during his correction.The offer is to Lord Umaya!200!If the price of slaves is raised,we shall have to bailourselves next year.Take him!He is no use to me anymore!Kill him or take him,I'm finished with him!We are declaring ourselves.God has told his messengerto declare Islam to all men!Open the windows!Let the world hear!We are coming out of the darkness!Hear well the word of God!Hear well the messenger of God!There are no other gods but Godand Muhammad is his messenger.There are no other gods but Godand Muhammad is his messenger.We have come into light,join us in the march to the Kaaba!God is most great,God is most great!God has no partner!We have come into light,join us in the march to the Kaaba!Muhammad and his rebellioncalled Islam are coming out,to foul our godsand dethrone religion.Don't let them reach the Kaaba!Throw them back! Defend your gods!!There is no god but Godand Muhammad is the messenger of God.There is no god but Godand Muhammad is the messenger of God.There is no god but Godand Muhammad is the messenger of God.Protect the prophet!There is no god but Godand Muhammad is the messenger of God.Guards!God is great!This is blasphemy you idiot!God is great!God is great!God is great!There is no god but Godand Muhammad is the messenger of God.Now's the time to break them,there are only 30 of them.No, we've done enough.More will only create sympathy for them.God is great!Stand down!God is great!God is great!In the name of God,most gracious, most merciful.Say: O you who reject faith,I worship not what you worship.Keep him out of the Kaaba!I worship not what you worship.Keep him out of the Kaaba!Lead them out!Neither do you worship what i worship.Lead them out!Neither do you worship what i worship.Silence, you're a false prophet!Neither do you worship what i worship.Silence, you're a false prophet!Finish Muhammad!Protect the prophet!Finish Muhammad!Protect the prophet!Messenger of God,back to the corner!Hamza! Hamza!You are brave.He is the bravest man in the desert...when he meets unarmed men.Muhammad is...is a liar!Liar?If you don't let him speak!Where's the lie and where's the truth...when it hasn't been spoken yet?Muhammad is a fraud!Stand up! Hit me back if you dare!I affirm my nephew's religionand I say what he says!Whoever has the courage to fight,fight with me!Muhammad, when I hunt the desert at night...I know God...is not kept in a house.Who would have thought that Hamza,Hamza above all,with his wine drinking, lion hunting...would come to join Muhammad?The more we attack him,more they seem to join him.Where does he find his words?I don't know.How can an illiterate mango up on a mountainand come down three days later,blazing with poetry?If it were just poetry...he says it's God.How do we fight someone whosestrength we do not understand?Muhammad promises heaven,trees in the skies.So naturally he's found an audience.Then we must make that audienceless eager to listen to him.We will begin with the weaker ones.Your turn!Have mercy!Stretch her!Who is your God?Answer me!Say it!Say Hubal is your God!Say it!There is only one Godand Muhammad is the messenger of God!Oh my god!Ammar!Your father and motherare the first martyrs of Islam!You are promised paradise!How much are you men prepared to suffer?The Prophet has said we must leave Mecca.If you stay,they will kill you...one by one.Muhammad says that in Abyssinia,there is a Christian King.No man is wronged in his country.We must leave now, today.Uthman!God be praised!Let us go.We found their tracksand followed them,but they just disappeared!They were there...in the desert, under the vulturesand you let them escape you!Escape? They vanished!If Muhammad has stayed,then only the weakest have gone.Weak or strong,they'll blacken our name.We're honest merchants,we buy and sell in good faith.We cannot afford scandal.Abyssinia...Amr!You are a friend of Annajashi, the king?Yes.Can you use that friendship?I think I can bring them back...yes.Abyssinia...Rise up Amr.Please, nothing you may askfor that we will not give.Lion of Judah, I...I don't know where to begin.You have our friendship,begin there.Certain runaway slaves have escapedfrom us into your kingdom.Slaves go back, as you no doubtwould returned our slaves to us.There are however somefree men among them...rebels.Rebels?Disturbance in Arabia,why am I not informed?They are rebels in religion.At one time or another,all religions were rebellions.The bodies of slaves of the worldand beaten are disposal.But as Jesus Christ as our shepherd,the souls of men are his sheep.These are Arabs who have betrayedthe religion of their fathers.They follow a lunaticthey call...a Prophet.But I cannot put souls intochains without hearing them.Good, they're stiffnext we'll hang them.Do you not bow to yourselfbefore your prophet?Muhammad is a man,we kneel only to God.Where are Muhammad's miracles, Jafar?If he were a prophet,he'd light the sky with miraclesIndeed, this is true.God has given his prophetsthe signs of miraclesthat we may recognize them.The miracle of Muhammadis the Holy Quran.A book! A book!Written by an illiterate,attributed to God.I think the emperor has had enough!I'm mindful of petty costs.When God set down tongues of fireupon the heads of Christ's apostles,so they could speak themany languages of the worldthat they knew not before.But do such miracles happen in our times?I've heard enough!You've made a poor case.When we suffered persecution in Mecca,Muhammad told us,go to Abyssinia,the land of the righteous king,where no man is wronged!What they call persecutionwas fair punishment,that is order, now...Why did your prophet send you to me?Because you believe in the bookof the one God as we do.He sent us because in your heart,God will protect us.Talking with him is likedrawing water from a mirage.But they've now belay that duty onme to listen to them, my friend.Go on!For years, we worshipedwood and stone,images of our own manufacture.We lived in ignorance of God.We had few earthly lawsand no heavenly laws.The rich neglect the poor.And the natural pity of man,whereby he lifts his brotherup when he has fallen...is described by them asupsetting social order!To this inhumanity,has come a man...whom God chose...and in that we believe.You've overcome, I begyou to collect yourself.I speak of the messenger of God.Muhammad teaches usto worship one god,to speak truth,to love our neighbors as ourselves,to give charity,even a smile can be charity.To protect women from misuse,to shelter orphans...and to turn away fromgods of wood and stone!I cannot keep still andhear this blasphemy!We are an ancient civilization...to call our gods wood and stoneis to speak ignorantly of them.The idol...the form,is not what we worship,but the spirit that resides within the form.I agree that idolatry is notalways fully understood.Thank you.Now let me bring him back to the women.God made woman to be theproper companion of man.She is different but equal.Equal?!We buy them.Feed them, clothe them,use them, discard them...women equal to us?God created man fromone male and one female.Amr, you must respect in allwoman the womb that bore you.Why are your \n",
      "guards so tongue-tied?While this only guard is eloquent.God has spoken to us before...through Abraham, Noah, Mosesand through Jesus Christ.Why should we be so surprised that Godspeaks to us now through Muhammad?Who taught you those names?They are named in the Quran.I knew Muhammad when hewas an orphan minding sheep!And we knew Christ as a carpenter.What Christ saysand what your Muhammad saysis like two raised from the same land.They are lying to you,they deny Christ.You worship three gods, they say.Father, Son and Holy Ghost, they say.What do you say of Christ?They say God cannot have a son.Christ is not the Son of God.Speak to me of Christ.We say of Christ whatour prophet has taught us...that God cast his holy spirit intothe womb of a virgin named, Maryand that she conceivedChrist, the Apostle of God.The Apostle he says,not the son, not the son!What does your miracle, your Quran,say of the birth of our dear Lord Jesus Christ?May I relate the words?Come closer to me.In the name of God,most gracious, most merciful.Relate in the book, the story of Mary.How she withdrew from herfamily to a place in the east.How we sent to her ourangel, Gabriel, who said:''I am a messenger from your God\"\"to announce the birthof a holy son to you.\"She said: \"How shall I, Mary, have a sonwhen no man has touched me?''And Gabriel replied:\"For your Lord says, it will happen.\"We appoint him as a sign onto man...and a mercy from us.It is a thing ordained.The difference between us and you,is not bigger than this line.Not for a mountain of goldwill I give them up to you.You may live in Abyssinia, in peace,for as long as you wish.May God's blessings be upon you,when you return.lntolerable!Mohamed disturbs evenour foreign alliances!Very well!We will make a foreigner of him!Abu Talib,has his arms around him.Very well!We will throw uncleand nephew out.In one bundle, his whole family out.We will expel them from ourselves.No merchant may trade with them.No land remain to them.No roof shelter them.No beggar beg for them.No woman marry them.Until they renounce, they can't.These were the worstyears of Muhammad's life.For three years they suffered the hunger,thirst, cruelty of the open desert.But the year of grief was still to come,when Khadija, Muhammad'swife for 24 years, died.When Abu Talib,his old Protector, died...with his last breath, Abu Talib,tried again to reconcileMecca and Muhammad.He never asked more from you......than one word.One...one God.If it were only a question of one word,we would have given him ten words.But the word he wants,would dethrone all the gods.You were afraid even to hear him.With the death of his uncle,Muhammad has now lost all protection.He was no longer safe in Mecca.Alone with Zaid, his adopted son,he went to the hillside town of Taif.He asked to be taken in,to be allowed to preach.But the children ofTaif were turned loose,to stone him back into the desert.What are you doing?!Stop! Stop!Leave him alone! Go away!Muhammad called this,the bitterest day of his life.Then miraculously,when Muhammad's missionseemed to have failed,his entire situation changed.A deputation from the rich,but self-destroying city of Medina,met him by night atthe rocks of Aqaba,asking him to come to them,to stand between their factions,to mediate their continualquarrels and civil wars.Muhammad agreed...provided they gave him a pledgethat they worship the one God only.Wait!When we take this pledge we expelourselves from the rest of Arabia.So, wait!War is in this pledge.We are to makeenemies of brothers.We are to makefirewood of our gods!That is the meaning of the pledge.If we take it, there canbe no turning back...for Muhammad is indeedthe messenger of God,foretold to us bythe Jews in our city.So if anyone has doubtin this pledge, go now.And if you have no doubts,then you do as I do.I pledge myself tothe one and only God,and to you Muhammad,the messenger of God.He is of us and we are of him.Let him bring his followers,our brothers, to us, to Medina. Sync, Corrections by  Pocong@LTTi This was a journeythat changed the world.The Hijra, or Flight to Medina.Only 70 peoplesplit up into small groups,walking 250 miles of desert.Yet, so profound were the consequences,so lasting were the effects of this walkthat from it the muslimsdate their calendar.In this moment, Islam found it's future.Muhammad himself stayed inMecca, in the greatest dangeruntil all his followers had left safely.Muhammad has become a nation,he has received a city,entering into pledges and treatiesand you, Salool, who claimto be king of Medinalost the kingdom last nightwhile you were in bed!You should worry aboutyourself, Abu Sufian.Every time you trade awhiff of perfume out the city,you must creep pastthat man in Medina.He is across yourmercantile throat so to speak.And what do you intend to do?l intend to wait.And how long will you wait?Till you and the rest of Arabia remove him,to save your way of life.And while you wait?I should accept his call of course.Does he think I willgive him my birthright?I will not.Medina is worth the conversion.Hypocrisy.Of course it's...a healthy hypocrisy.King Salool,wiping his face on the floor5 times a day praying?I don't believe you.He may not have to.We'll do know what weshould have done before:kill Muhammad.Come, come and see.They say that practiceleads to perfection.7 young men eachfrom a different family,my own son Ikrima is with them.They will stab him together.If the responsibility for his deathis shared, where lies the guilt?My idea.I'm not sure I'm part of it.Muhammad's body contains too much...his mind, his words...But it is an ingenious solution.And a final one.No!Ali, his cousin, laid there to die for him?Who are we fighting?They cannot go far, allthe tracks are watched.He must take to the desert.Bakkah will give100 camels to the manwho brings back Muhammad......or his head!Look for 3 of them:Muhammad,Abu Bakr,and Uriqat, his Bedouin guide.What is it?They're not grazing camel.Maybe two days, that from the city.Why are you here?Medina is to the north.They make the tracks, not I.Nomads? Travelling west?I know my art.They say that you can tracka bird by smelling the air.We go with them.He may be in that cave over there.Muhammad, if you come out,we will take you to Mecca alive.Muhammad, come out!They can't be in there,this...this web is unbroken.And these pigeons,they would not build.We were wrong to follow themwe should have gone north.Let's move then.We still have time to head them off.A few threads of a spider's webwere all that was then betweenMuhammad and murder.But he was a man not to be killed.The Bedouin guide led him and hiscompanion, Abu Bakr, in their escapethrough untracked spaces of the desertand the heat of the June days.At Medina, his followerswaited with their welcome readybut in great fear for his journey.Anything?No, nothing.He himself says he is only a man.No man can survive that heat.- There! I see them!- Look!Run and hide.I may be obligedto free you as a gesture.Welcome to the cityof Medina, the blessed.Your city, messenger of God.You will stay with me,messenger of God.I have the best house in Medina.You will give me thehonor of keeping you.Stay with me!Please! Please! Please!How can the Prophet choosebetween so many welcomes?Where God guides his camel to stop,there he will build his house.All agreed?We turn Quaswa, his camel looseand where Quaswa sits, the Prophet stays.Clever man.A choice made by acamel can offend no one.Here we will buildthe house of the Prophet.And our first meetingplace, a prayer house!The first mosque of Islam, here!God is great! God is great!What is the prophet of God doing?Carrying bricks?Give me that.Look, you are doing too much.Please, go and sit down...we'll do it.Look! He went for more.\"Work is a worship\" he says.He's 53 years old.How old are you?There is something missing.Maybe a bell to call the people in.- The Christians use a bell?- Mmm (yes).What about a horn, like the Jews?A drum?There's too much blood in a drum.Why not the human voice...as in Umar ibn Khattab's vision?The Prophet agrees?He means you, Bilal.Me?You have a good voice, use it.Climb up there.Brothers!Today, a man of Medina,will embrace a man of Mecca.Each will share half and half.Reach out, embrace yourneighbor and brother.I'm tired of the politics ofkissing slaves, read this!The prophet should concernhimself with the after-world.How is my son?Praying like a horse.Does it burn your hands?If it's not torn up,it will burn down the house.He's making laws like a king.He has declared that loyalty to Islamis more than loyalty to tribal family.What?All muslims are next of kin to one-another?Don't be mislead by that.They must change thenature of the tribes before that.The danger is here, equality:a man's neighbour is as good as himself.The lunatic means it!Jews and Christians haveequal rights with Muslims.The Jews who attach themselves to acommon wealth shall be protected.- Women have rights of inheritance?- Rights.Next, he'll be giving the camel rights.He has! The lunatic has!You can't overload them.He's remaking a city, my city!Damn him!He's taken our sons from us,our future from us.His rights... are wrongs!No more.This time... it willnot be just his riffraff.We will take everything ofvalue they have left in Mecca.Their rugs, their houses, their silver...and with it, a large of caravan to Damascus.My friends, listen to me!I have news from Mecca!Everything you have left behind is gone!The thieves!Abu Bakr's shops,the prophet's house... sold!Every cup or piece of cloth,every rag or bone you everowned is thrown on the market.You are a people of nothing.Don't you even fight for what you own?Who talks of the fight?What other way is there, Hamza?When the Prophetsays fight, we fight.Now he says, peace.Exactly!You are a peace loving people!Up to your necks and fore-bearers.Go back to work.We have to defend ourselves.You are the messenger of God.Yet, they mock...abuse and plunder usand we do nothing.In the package of war, we are pathetic!But they are led by greed.We are led by God...and you.Now I...I know how you hate the sword,but we have to fight.They have stolen our property.They are taking it to Damascus,right past our own door.I say by God, get back!I'm sorry I'm carried away.It's the pounding in my head.Please... fight them!But... look at the sun.It's not the time for prayer.It is newly revealedby God to his messenger.Fight, but fight in the way of God,against those who fight against you.Drive them out of the placeswhere they drove you out,for persecution is worse than slaughter.Fight them until persecution is no moreand religion is for God.But if they stop,let there be no more war...for God never lovesthe starter of wars.So, fight in the way of Godagainst those who fight against you!- God is great!- God is great!! God is great!!- God is great!- God is great!!These are the disciplinesthe Prophet puts upon you.You may not harm a woman,a child or any old person!You may not harm cripples!You may not harm theman that works in the field!You may not cut down trees!Strike only at those who have expelled you!Who have stolen your rights andriched themselves with your possessions!Now, to the wells of Badr!News from Medina!Arm... arm yourselves!Arm yourselves!Defend your wealth!Muhammad has come out of Medinato attack the great caravan!- How many men?- Three hundred, two horses.We man a 100 horses.How many camels?- Seventy.- We'll bring a hundred and seventy!And load twenty of my camelswith wine, we'll make a feast of it.This is a war I'd like to fight,a war we cannot lose!Ride to Abu Sofyan's caravan,tell him to turn towards Badr.We will join our forcestomorrow at the wells of Badr.The wells of Badr, here.Muhammad's march, here.My charge of the caravan, here.One day's march...meet them at the wells.I don't like it.There is too much of Meccain my caravan to be risked.Put out the fires!Hold the camels!We are turning west,away from the wells.Away?You can't!You must meet them at Badr.We can drink them down like raw eggs.If I run all night, I'll be out ofMuhammad's reach by morning.Where is your honor, Abu Sofyan?!Honor?My honor is on thebacks of my camels.Yes, I run...Muhammad has occupied the wells!He has moved directlyinto our line of march.Abu Sofyan has broken camp.He's moving west, away from Badr.The caravan is safe.So, there is no need to fight.Not fight?If we fight, we will startblood feuds between brothers.Between father and son, you mean.Hudayfa, your own son is with them,he should have been whipped.Mecca is greater than your family!Waleed, your second son,he is your true blood.I say: fight!We stand in the presentlet the future look after itself.Otba is not a coward.We finish them tomorrow.- We fight!- We fight!!!Are you finished?!Form ranks, battle positions!Each man to his own place!Go back to your columns!Move away... move back!So Muhammad's filled the wells.Now everyone brought herewill have to fight, for theirs.Good, we fight!Brothers, we hold the wells.We stand in the name ofGod and his messenger.We wait.Send us your champions!(BATTLE OF BADR)Who are you?!We expect our peersand our equals!Come back!My brother, Shaiba!My son, Waleed!And myself!Not you.Ubaida and I...and Ali.Are we your equals?There is only one Godand Muhammad is His messenger.Archers!

Find him!Back, back to the mountains!Halt!I thought we were beaten!Now, victory is yours, Khalid.We have no victory untilwe have finished Muhammad.He is up in those rocks.We have finished our business,we have avenged Badr.But we can end him and Islam forever.Some of his fanatics are still with him.They have theadvantage of the mountains,the risk is too high.Muhammad, listen!A day for a day!The day of Uhubfor the day of Badr!Our dead have answered to your dead!Our dead are in paradise,your dead are in hell fire!Hamza... Hamza!Do you hear me, Hamza?Do you know thatI am with you, I, Hind!Do you remember anything, Hamza?How you killed myfather and my brother?!Now you too are dead!My heart is light!Do you hear, Hamza? Light!But I haven't finished with you!Death is too small.Wahshi, cut him open, cut him!They lost a battleand what do they do?They come home anddig the ground harder.- They're mad.- I agree with you!They defy reason,they are even happy they lost!God sent their defeat they say,to try them in their faith.Oh yes! They arefighting with the sky.They'll get what they want.They want Mecca.They'll get Mecca.When we see the stars at noon...Don't underestimate them,I've learned that to my cost.My friend, Mecca ismore than their home.It's where God spoke to man.Mecca is like a...homesickness to the soul.This year they're going as pilgrims.What?!Unarmed.Unarmed?Abu Sofyan will slaughterthem in the desert.If you believe in God as they do,it might be possiblenot to get slaughtered.But I agree with you,they probably will be.Be still!Do not let them provoke you,that is what they want!Stand firm!Peace be to you.The Prophet says: All who love Godmust renew their oaths to him.Under the tree!They've sent someone else.It's Suheil!That means we mightcome to an agreement.Muhammad, you have beengiven conditions of trucebetween yourself and Mecca.Have you agreed to them yet?What is this?In the name of God, the most gracious...Who is this new Godthey call, gracious?I do not know him,strike him out.And I cannot agree with this...\"Muhammad, the messenger of God?\"If I have thought youwere the messenger of God,I would not have fought you.Make it, \"Muhammad, the son of Abdullahagrees with Suhayl, the son of Amr.\"That is more factual.Well, so I understand.Good, that is better.Now, it is agreed...that you do notcontinue your pilgrimage,you must turn around and go home.Mecca is home.However...you may continue yourpilgrimage next year,and for 3 days only,in and out.We also agree to thetruce, for 10 years.During that time,you will not attack any tribe,or ambush any caravan,or any individual associatedwith us and vice versa.If you injure any oneof us, the truce ends......and vice versa.Is that clear?Ten years, ten years of peace.We need that time.We will use that time.These letters, from Muhammad,messenger of God,to the rulers of the world......call the world to Islam!To Heraclius, Emperor of Byzantium,Kisra, Emperor of Persia,Muqawqis, Patriarch of Alexandria.God go with you!God is great! God is great! God is great!There are no different races in Islam.An Arab is not superior to a foreigner.Nor a white man superior to a black.All return equally to God.Unless you desire for your neighbour,what you desire for yourself......you don't have faith.A man goes to bed with his belly full,while his neighbor is hungry......he isn't a Muslim.The Ink of a scholar is holierthan the blood of a martyr.A man reading is handsomein the sight of God.So, learn to read.And when you have learned......teach!The people of the book,the Jews with their Bible,the Christians with their testament,must be respected by you.For their books likewisecame from God.You must not think ofMuhammad as more than a man.He was collecting firewood one day.\"Let me do it,\" I said.\"Why?\" he said.\"You are the prophet of God!\"\"You can't go aroundscratching for firewood.\"But he looked at me, mumbling,\"God does not like the man who considershimself above other men,\" he said.So, I laid back and watched him.Suddenly, he stopped.He stood to his fullheight and came to me.\"Yes, I am the prophet of God,\" he said.\"But even I do not knowwhat will become of me.\"Amr, have you come to take me again?No.I have come to ask you to take me.I witness that there is only one God,and that Muhammad is His messenger.May God forgive me the timesI have fought against you.Islam does away withall that went before it.I'm sorry, I came in here wearing...Here are my jewels.What they are worth......I give to the poor.- And may I offer you my...- Yes.But you were thebitterest sword against Islam.Now by the will of God......I will be the raised sword of God.Ah, its all easy to God.Just as he makes dying living,he can make losing winning.Two years ago we thought we werebeaten when we had to sign that truce.Look at us now.Charging from victory tovictory in the hearts of men.What's that?Abu Sofyan is coming!Abu Sofyan!Why am I insulted like this?I'm Abu Sofyan!I expect some courtesy!We are not at war,we have a truce!I have come to speak toMuhammad, where is he?He is in the mosque.Muhammad, we did not break the truce.I have come to reaffirm the truce.I speak for Mecca.Muhammad, why do you turn from me?Don't go.Muhammad, don't go!Bedouins broke the truce, not us!The night was dark!I am here to testify,the night was dark!Barra, Barra this is your city!Hudayfa, you are my kin,aim to see for me!I must be heard!I am Mecca!I am the leader of Mecca!Why am I insulted like this?!Because you keep no promiseand respect no pledge.I have heard whatI never thought I'd hear:Abu Sofyan asking for pity.To be outfought, outfought,outmaneuvered by a one-time shepherd!You saw that shepherd'sreligion grow from a speck.Speck was in my eye...I could see nothing.Tell Mecca their gods are dead.It is useless to resist God.Travel fast, or every man herewill be close behind you.It's you who have broken the truce.For tonight will be ten thousand,men from every tribe.Now we can fight them, you are back.We will close the streets,and defend from the houses.It's no use.There are thousands of them,every hour they are joined by more.You coward!Hind, go home!You coward!Are you the leader of Mecca?!Look at yourself!You are broke, they swallowedyou and spat you back!Did my father and brother die,for my husband to run away?!You go home! You!We can not resist! Mecca is taken.No, no!We are to camp here for the night.I can see Mecca, eventhrough the mountains.So many fires, I cannot count them.It's very beautiful.When we drove them out of Mecca,I did not know theycarried Mecca with them.We can smell the bread they're baking.Yes, it means they don't intend to plunder,at least I hope that's what it means.They don't want blood ontheir own walls and doorsteps.I can bargain with that.Take me to him.So you are giving us the city?You offer me no bread.I understand.You may decide to kill me.Say what you have come to say.I saw your fires,the men around them,and I know what poweryou put into your men.We can no longer resist Muhammad.Now if you'll agree.You dare to come hereand ask for conditions?Isn't it time yet for you torecognize who Muhammad is?Muhammad, there isstill doubt in my heart.If I were to cut off your head,it would remove all your doubts.Khalid,there's no compulsion in religion.A man may take many yearsor only need minutes.It's God who decides the time.So respect his doubts.You're a black slave,you are the best school.I am only what God has given me.Yes.The gods that I worshipped,they don't have any use.It would have helped me.I declare, under no compulsion:there is one God,and you are the messenger of God.Now, let me go.Get inside!No doors may be broken down,nothing plundered, nothing seized!No one abused!All behind closed doors are safe!All in Abu Sofyan's house are safe!All by the Kaaba are safe!At least he kept his word,they haven't forced a door.He's stolen hearts, not walls.It's a permanent victory.I dread going out.We must, we must at the end.Were we so wrong?The way we lived,yes, that was wrong.We were trapped in our own faults.Our gods were less than us.Now there he is, makinghis entrance to the Kaaba.In the name of God,most gracious, most merciful.God gave this house toAbraham to be a sacred place.Worship no other gods but Himand cleanse his house.So it was.Muhammad took norevenge and allowed none.He declared Mecca a holy place.No one may shed bloodor cut down a tree,or kill a living thing in Mecca.Soon, all Arabia was converted. Not only to the new worshipbut to the new laws, manners,attitudes contained in Islam.The Prophet had livedto see his work done,but now he began tofeel the nearness of death.One great act of hisprophethood remained,the setting of it's seal.He called the people to himand he spoke for the last timeHis message of surrender to Godand humanity to man.''Oh, mankind! Listen well!\"\"I may not be with you much longer.\"\"The weak among you,feed them on what you eat.\"\"Dress them as you are dressed.\"\"You will meet your God,\"\"and He will call you toaccount for your actions.\"\"Let those who are presentwarn those who are absent.\"\"You are all are descendant from Adam,\"\"and the best among youis he who most regards God.\"\"Think deeply about what I say.\"\"Let all your feuds be abolished.\"\"You must know that every Muslimis the brother of every other Muslim.\"\"And all Muslims arebrothers one of another.\"\"Between Muslims, thereare no races and no tribes.\"\"Nor must you takeanything from your brother,\"\"except what is given freely.\"\"Do not oppressand do not be oppressed.\"\"O my people,\"\"I am but a man.\"\"It may be that the angelof death will visit me soon,\"\"and death will overtake me.\"\"But I have left you a book,\"\"revealed by God, the Quran,\"\"which is light and guidance.\"Now he repeated to the peoplethe final revelation of the Quran,the seal and termination,not Muhammad's words,but God's word:''This day I have perfectedyour religion for you\"\"and completed my favour to you\"\"and I've chosen for youIslam as your religion.''On June the 8th, 632,in his 63rd year,Muhammad died.Many of his followerscould not believe the fact.How can such a man die?But Abu Bakr, the Prophet's friendstood up in the mosque:\"If anyone worships Muhammad,\"\"let him know that Muhammad is dead.\"\"But he who worships God,\"\"let him know that Godis alive and can not die.''They buried Muhammadbeside his mosque, in Medina.But the religion he preachedfound it's place in the heart of man.It endured. It multiplied.Still to Mecca they come, mankind.The people of Islamdressed in their pilgrim white.All equal before God,all united in this place of prayer.Each individual soul joinedin a community of worship:\"ONE GOD\" Synced By JiSiNPlease rate this subtitle at www.osdb.link/agwmaHelp other users to choose the best subtitles\n"

The gods of theKaaba have their needs,their upkeeps.Who is that man who stood there,who looked into my soul?Carry me away from here.Why must Muhammad come down here?Why don't you stop him?He is your nephew.Maybe he will change.Change?He is 40 years old.It's unnatural...with a rich wife, he couldafford the best of Mecca.Yet he chooses to sit shivering in a cave.It is unnatural!For a man who dares torisk the anger of Al-Uzza,who keeps our health.Manat, the god of our prosperity.Allat, the god of ourfamily and tribes.and Hubal...Hubal, who starts our caravansand predicts our fate.To challenge the gods within earshotof the gods is dangerous.Unreasonable.Rebellious, blasphemous.Yes, I'm afraid Muhammadwill harm himself.I am always sadwhen the great fair is over.I might not see the next one.Abu Talib! Abu Talib!Catch your breath, Zaid!Has Muhammad come downfrom Mount Hira yet?He's been up there three days.No, no, I haven't seen him.Khadijah hoped he might havecome to you on his way home.Then he's still up there.Three days.I'm afraid for him on the mountain,because...I don't know what it means.Men see the world too wellfrom a mountain.Muhammad! Read!In the name of thy Lord who createdman from His sensitive drop of blood.Who teaches man what he knows not.Read!He's still trembling under the blanket...but he has spoken.Zaid! What happened tomy nephew on the mountain?He was alone, in the cave.Suddenly, an angel came in to him.The angel said: Read!Muhammad replied: I can not read.The angel commanded again: Read!In the name of thy Lord,who created man fromHis sensitive drop of blood,who teaches man what he knows not.Read!Who knows if it was Gabriel?It could have been a dream.When Muhammad was coming fromthe mountain, he saw Gabriel plainly.In the shape of a manstanding on the horizon.Wherever he looked,upon every turn ofhis head he saw him.And Gabriel said to him again,I am Gabriel...and you Muhammad,are the Messenger of God.Who has he told about this?His wife,and Ali,and, his friend Abu Bakr.And you?I am his adopted son.Be careful to whom you talk.Tell him his uncle who protected himwhen he was a child, will protect him still.After all...they say the God of Mosesspoke to him out of a burning bush.If you do not restrainyour nephew then we will.He's dividing the city,heart against house.He's dividing the generationschild against parent.The young are listening to him.He attracts the young.We are Arabs,we obey our fathers.Our children cannot be our teachers.How can we accept that the manwe met in the street yesterdaycan be some God's Prophet today?Dead bones can live again, he saysbecause He who created mancan also make man returnfrom the dead, he says!The Gods might leave us andgive their benefits to another city.Tell him...we will give himauthority, position,and keys to the Kaaba,and money, what money he wants.Tell him, we will givehim anything he wants.Muhammad, spare yourself...and me.Do not put a greater burden onan old man that he can bear.In your childhood, you were in my arms.I cannot now see you hurt.If you refuse them...they will hurt you.He said this to me:Were they to put the sun in myright hand and the moon in my left,I would not renounce my message,which is from God.When I am dead,you may do as you please,but whilst I'm alive,you will obey your father!Why did you hurt our father?If I were drunk every dayand played dice every night,you'd call it high spirits!You will be more mybrother than you are now!You are all my children.I've given you everything I could,but it seems not to be enough.Muhammad gives me more,he give all the world more.Get him out of here, father!It's not Waleed or me,it's our father.You tortured him.Wait Hudayfa, wait!How can they sayit's an invention, Musab,when it isn't new?In Mecca, it's new.Yet, God has said it all before...to Noah, Moses, Jesusto all the Prophets,but people changed it,turned it, forgot it.Now God said it to Muhammad again...and it is new again.What is it?It's Jafar.What have you brought with you?The very word of God.When the sun is overthrown.When the stars fall.When the mountains vanish.When the camels big withyoung are abandoned.When the wild beasts are herded together.When the seas rise.When the souls are sorted.When the female infantwho is buried alive,asks for what crime she was killed.When the books are opened.When the sky is torn away,then...every soul...will know what it has done.Were you there, Jafarwhen God gave him these words?Dawn is coming up.Ammar, you first,then you Jaafar.Ammar!You kept your mother awakeall night with worry.I'm sorry father.Where were you?Have you been with Muhammad again?What will happen now?Forgive him, it wasmy fault, I did it.That God has helped us all our lives.But it fell...it could not even help itself.What talk have you been listening to?The real god is unseen.He's not made of clay.Ammar, we see the godsin the Kaaba every day.I'm afraid for you.You're listening to peoplewho will hurt you.I'm listening to Muhammad, mother.Muhammad is generous, yes.He gives, he shares,he'll pass no man without a smile,but he is spreading dangerous ideas.Dangerous ideas,that no man should start?That the rich should not afloat the poor?The strong should not oppress the weak?Are these dangerous ideas?Girls should not be forced into marriage,but be able to choose or refuse.By only tonight, he said;Stop the burial of new-born girls.I was fortunate, alwaysfortunate with your mother.Yes, but you know that you and Inearly never met, Yasser.And you were nearly never born.I was to be buried,like my two sisters,but my father couldn't do it.He couldn't do it the third time.When the second girl was being...when my father was putting sand over her,she took hold of his finger,the way a baby does.He told my mother afterwards,that it was a minute...before the tender little grip eased...and he dared take away his hand.When I was born,my father ran out of the housescreaming that he couldn't do it again,that he could never do it again.Sumayyah, it is the custom.But it's wrong.The gods that let suchthings be are no gods.I promised to go to Muhammad'shouse mama, we pray there.Yes! He is a good man.Yes...yes, you go.Two men are following him.Read? Muhammad canneither write nor read.But he can speak.What did you say?He can speak?Well, so can you so now,you speak up young man.What does Muhammad say, umm?They are God's words, not his.Which god's?What words?A speaking god?Your Muhammadspeaks only to himself.When God reveals Hismessage to Muhammad,he remembers every wordthen he tells it to those who can write...this is the Quran.Muhammad has starvedhimself into dreams.He hides under a blanketwith his eyes shut.His eyes are shutbut his heart is open.You! Kick him for his cleverness.There is no purpose in that.Doesn't Muhammad realize, welive by giving housing to the gods?We own the Kaaba.Every year, the tribes ofArabia come here to Meccato pray and to buy from us.Now, were we to replace300 Gods with just one?Whom we cannot even see, who issupposed to be in Taif and Medina,here in my house,in Jerusalem, on the moon?Where would Mecca be then?The gods are both ourworship and our revenue.You cannot buy and sell God.Young man, you areclose to the whip.Ammar, be sensible boy.I have a question.Muhammad teaches you,a slave is equal to his master.This black Bilal, who Ipaid money for...equal to me?Yes Muhammad says...before God, all men are asequal as the teeth of a comb.This is a very pleasant ideato slaves and beggars.It gives them pretensions.Bilal!Teach this man the differencebetween the Lord of Mecca and a slave.Take that whip.Lash his face, toteach his mouth a lesson.Whip him!Whip him!Cut him!Whip him!Do it Bilal!Obey them!They will kill you!See what anarchy they bring!They've even infected our slaves!If you're human enoughto have gods......remember!They are the gods of your owner!I bought your humanity Bilalwhen I bought you.You will be corrected!One, one God.There is only one God!Who is stronger now?Your masteror this one god of yours?One God.There is only one God.Bring the stones!One God.One......one God.Crush him!Break him!Have you finished with him?There is only one God!- One God!- You could swear the slave was preaching!- One God!- Lord Umaya!Abu Bakr will pay a \n",
      "dinars for this slave.Wait now!It's against our social orderto sell a slave during his correction.The offer is to Lord Umaya!200!If the price of slaves is raised,we shall have to bailourselves next year.Take him!He is no use to me anymore!Kill him or take him,I'm finished with him!We are declaring ourselves.God has told his messengerto declare Islam to all men!Open the windows!Let the world hear!We are coming out of the darkness!Hear well the word of God!Hear well the messenger of God!There are no other gods but Godand Muhammad is his messenger.There are no other gods but Godand Muhammad is his messenger.We have come into light,join us in the march to the Kaaba!God is most great,God is most great!God has no partner!We have come into light,join us in the march to the Kaaba!Muhammad and his rebellioncalled Islam are coming out,to foul our godsand dethrone religion.Don't let them reach the Kaaba!Throw them back! Defend your gods!!There is no god but Godand Muhammad is the messenger of God.There is no god but Godand Muhammad is the messenger of God.There is no god but Godand Muhammad is the messenger of God.Protect the prophet!There is no god but Godand Muhammad is the messenger of God.Guards!God is great!This is blasphemy you idiot!God is great!God is great!God is great!There is no god but Godand Muhammad is the messenger of God.Now's the time to break them,there are only 30 of them.No, we've done enough.More will only create sympathy for them.God is great!Stand down!God is great!God is great!In the name of God,most gracious, most merciful.Say: O you who reject faith,I worship not what you worship.Keep him out of the Kaaba!I worship not what you worship.Keep him out of the Kaaba!Lead them out!Neither do you worship what i worship.Lead them out!Neither do you worship what i worship.Silence, you're a false prophet!Neither do you worship what i worship.Silence, you're a false prophet!Finish Muhammad!Protect the prophet!Finish Muhammad!Protect the prophet!Messenger of God,back to the corner!Hamza! Hamza!You are brave.He is the bravest man in the desert...when he meets unarmed men.Muhammad is...is a liar!Liar?If you don't let him speak!Where's the lie and where's the truth...when it hasn't been spoken yet?Muhammad is a fraud!Stand up! Hit me back if you dare!I affirm my nephew's religionand I say what he says!Whoever has the courage to fight,fight with me!Muhammad, when I hunt the desert at night...I know God...is not kept in a house.Who would have thought that Hamza,Hamza above all,with his wine drinking, lion hunting...would come to join Muhammad?The more we attack him,more they seem to join him.Where does he find his words?I don't know.How can an illiterate mango up on a mountainand come down three days later,blazing with poetry?If it were just poetry...he says it's God.How do we fight someone whosestrength we do not understand?Muhammad promises heaven,trees in the skies.So naturally he's found an audience.Then we must make that audienceless eager to listen to him.We will begin with the weaker ones.Your turn!Have mercy!Stretch her!Who is your God?Answer me!Say it!Say Hubal is your God!Say it!There is only one Godand Muhammad is the messenger of God!Oh my god!Ammar!Your father and motherare the first martyrs of Islam!You are promised paradise!How much are you men prepared to suffer?The Prophet has said we must leave Mecca.If you stay,they will kill you...one by one.Muhammad says that in Abyssinia,there is a Christian King.No man is wronged in his country.We must leave now, today.Uthman!God be praised!Let us go.We found their tracksand followed them,but they just disappeared!They were there...in the desert, under the vulturesand you let them escape you!Escape? They vanished!If Muhammad has stayed,then only the weakest have gone.Weak or strong,they'll blacken our name.We're honest merchants,we buy and sell in good faith.We cannot afford scandal.Abyssinia...Amr!You are a friend of Annajashi, the king?Yes.Can you use that friendship?I think I can bring them back...yes.Abyssinia...Rise up Amr.Please, nothing you may askfor that we will not give.Lion of Judah, I...I don't know where to begin.You have our friendship,begin there.Certain runaway slaves have escapedfrom us into your kingdom.Slaves go back, as you no doubtwould returned our slaves to us.There are however somefree men among them...rebels.Rebels?Disturbance in Arabia,why am I not informed?They are rebels in religion.At one time or another,all religions were rebellions.The bodies of slaves of the worldand beaten are disposal.But as Jesus Christ as our shepherd,the souls of men are his sheep.These are Arabs who have betrayedthe religion of their fathers.They follow a lunaticthey call...a Prophet.But I cannot put souls intochains without hearing them.Good, they're stiffnext we'll hang them.Do you not bow to yourselfbefore your prophet?Muhammad is a man,we kneel only to God.Where are Muhammad's miracles, Jafar?If he were a prophet,he'd light the sky with miraclesIndeed, this is true.God has given his prophetsthe signs of miraclesthat we may recognize them.The miracle of Muhammadis the Holy Quran.A book! A book!Written by an illiterate,attributed to God.I think the emperor has had enough!I'm mindful of petty costs.When God set down tongues of fireupon the heads of Christ's apostles,so they could speak themany languages of the worldthat they knew not before.But do such miracles happen in our times?I've heard enough!You've made a poor case.When we suffered persecution in Mecca,Muhammad told us,go to Abyssinia,the land of the righteous king,where no man is wronged!What they call persecutionwas fair punishment,that is order, now...Why did your prophet send you to me?Because you believe in the bookof the one God as we do.He sent us because in your heart,God will protect us.Talking with him is likedrawing water from a mirage.But they've now belay that duty onme to listen to them, my friend.Go on!For years, we worshipedwood and stone,images of our own manufacture.We lived in ignorance of God.We had few earthly lawsand no heavenly laws.The rich neglect the poor.And the natural pity of man,whereby he lifts his brotherup when he has fallen...is described by them asupsetting social order!To this inhumanity,has come a man...whom God chose...and in that we believe.You've overcome, I begyou to collect yourself.I speak of the messenger of God.Muhammad teaches usto worship one god,to speak truth,to love our neighbors as ourselves,to give charity,even a smile can be charity.To protect women from misuse,to shelter orphans...and to turn away fromgods of wood and stone!I cannot keep still andhear this blasphemy!We are an ancient civilization...to call our gods wood and stoneis to speak ignorantly of them.The idol...the form,is not what we worship,but the spirit that resides within the form.I agree that idolatry is notalways fully understood.Thank you.Now let me bring him back to the women.God made woman to be theproper companion of man.She is different but equal.Equal?!We buy them.Feed them, clothe them,use them, discard them...women equal to us?God created man fromone male and one female.Amr, you must respect in allwoman the womb that bore you.Why are your \n",
      "guards so tongue-tied?While this only guard is eloquent.God has spoken to us before...through Abraham, Noah, Mosesand through Jesus Christ.Why should we be so surprised that Godspeaks to us now through Muhammad?Who taught you those names?They are named in the Quran.I knew Muhammad when hewas an orphan minding sheep!And we knew Christ as a carpenter.What Christ saysand what your Muhammad saysis like two raised from the same land.They are lying to you,they deny Christ.You worship three gods, they say.Father, Son and Holy Ghost, they say.What do you say of Christ?They say God cannot have a son.Christ is not the Son of God.Speak to me of Christ.We say of Christ whatour prophet has taught us...that God cast his holy spirit intothe womb of a virgin named, Maryand that she conceivedChrist, the Apostle of God.The Apostle he says,not the son, not the son!What does your miracle, your Quran,say of the birth of our dear Lord Jesus Christ?May I relate the words?Come closer to me.In the name of God,most gracious, most merciful.Relate in the book, the story of Mary.How she withdrew from herfamily to a place in the east.How we sent to her ourangel, Gabriel, who said:''I am a messenger from your God\"\"to announce the birthof a holy son to you.\"She said: \"How shall I, Mary, have a sonwhen no man has touched me?''And Gabriel replied:\"For your Lord says, it will happen.\"We appoint him as a sign onto man...and a mercy from us.It is a thing ordained.The difference between us and you,is not bigger than this line.Not for a mountain of goldwill I give them up to you.You may live in Abyssinia, in peace,for as long as you wish.May God's blessings be upon you,when you return.lntolerable!Mohamed disturbs evenour foreign alliances!Very well!We will make a foreigner of him!Abu Talib,has his arms around him.Very well!We will throw uncleand nephew out.In one bundle, his whole family out.We will expel them from ourselves.No merchant may trade with them.No land remain to them.No roof shelter them.No beggar beg for them.No woman marry them.Until they renounce, they can't.These were the worstyears of Muhammad's life.For three years they suffered the hunger,thirst, cruelty of the open desert.But the year of grief was still to come,when Khadija, Muhammad'swife for 24 years, died.When Abu Talib,his old Protector, died...with his last breath, Abu Talib,tried again to reconcileMecca and Muhammad.He never asked more from you......than one word.One...one God.If it were only a question of one word,we would have given him ten words.But the word he wants,would dethrone all the gods.You were afraid even to hear him.With the death of his uncle,Muhammad has now lost all protection.He was no longer safe in Mecca.Alone with Zaid, his adopted son,he went to the hillside town of Taif.He asked to be taken in,to be allowed to preach.But the children ofTaif were turned loose,to stone him back into the desert.What are you doing?!Stop! Stop!Leave him alone! Go away!Muhammad called this,the bitterest day of his life.Then miraculously,when Muhammad's missionseemed to have failed,his entire situation changed.A deputation from the rich,but self-destroying city of Medina,met him by night atthe rocks of Aqaba,asking him to come to them,to stand between their factions,to mediate their continualquarrels and civil wars.Muhammad agreed...provided they gave him a pledgethat they worship the one God only.Wait!When we take this pledge we expelourselves from the rest of Arabia.So, wait!War is in this pledge.We are to makeenemies of brothers.We are to makefirewood of our gods!That is the meaning of the pledge.If we take it, there canbe no turning back...for Muhammad is indeedthe messenger of God,foretold to us bythe Jews in our city.So if anyone has doubtin this pledge, go now.And if you have no doubts,then you do as I do.I pledge myself tothe one and only God,and to you Muhammad,the messenger of God.He is of us and we are of him.Let him bring his followers,our brothers, to us, to Medina. Sync, Corrections by  Pocong@LTTi This was a journeythat changed the world.The Hijra, or Flight to Medina.Only 70 peoplesplit up into small groups,walking 250 miles of desert.Yet, so profound were the consequences,so lasting were the effects of this walkthat from it the muslimsdate their calendar.In this moment, Islam found it's future.Muhammad himself stayed inMecca, in the greatest dangeruntil all his followers had left safely.Muhammad has become a nation,he has received a city,entering into pledges and treatiesand you, Salool, who claimto be king of Medinalost the kingdom last nightwhile you were in bed!You should worry aboutyourself, Abu Sufian.Every time you trade awhiff of perfume out the city,you must creep pastthat man in Medina.He is across yourmercantile throat so to speak.And what do you intend to do?l intend to wait.And how long will you wait?Till you and the rest of Arabia remove him,to save your way of life.And while you wait?I should accept his call of course.Does he think I willgive him my birthright?I will not.Medina is worth the conversion.Hypocrisy.Of course it's...a healthy hypocrisy.King Salool,wiping his face on the floor5 times a day praying?I don't believe you.He may not have to.We'll do know what weshould have done before:kill Muhammad.Come, come and see.They say that practiceleads to perfection.7 young men eachfrom a different family,my own son Ikrima is with them.They will stab him together.If the responsibility for his deathis shared, where lies the guilt?My idea.I'm not sure I'm part of it.Muhammad's body contains too much...his mind, his words...But it is an ingenious solution.And a final one.No!Ali, his cousin, laid there to die for him?Who are we fighting?They cannot go far, allthe tracks are watched.He must take to the desert.Bakkah will give100 camels to the manwho brings back Muhammad......or his head!Look for 3 of them:Muhammad,Abu Bakr,and Uriqat, his Bedouin guide.What is it?They're not grazing camel.Maybe two days, that from the city.Why are you here?Medina is to the north.They make the tracks, not I.Nomads? Travelling west?I know my art.They say that you can tracka bird by smelling the air.We go with them.He may be in that cave over there.Muhammad, if you come out,we will take you to Mecca alive.Muhammad, come out!They can't be in there,this...this web is unbroken.And these pigeons,they would not build.We were wrong to follow themwe should have gone north.Let's move then.We still have time to head them off.A few threads of a spider's webwere all that was then betweenMuhammad and murder.But he was a man not to be killed.The Bedouin guide led him and hiscompanion, Abu Bakr, in their escapethrough untracked spaces of the desertand the heat of the June days.At Medina, his followerswaited with their welcome readybut in great fear for his journey.Anything?No, nothing.He himself says he is only a man.No man can survive that heat.- There! I see them!- Look!Run and hide.I may be obligedto free you as a gesture.Welcome to the cityof Medina, the blessed.Your city, messenger of God.You will stay with me,messenger of God.I have the best house in Medina.You will give me thehonor of keeping you.Stay with me!Please! Please! Please!How can the Prophet choosebetween so many welcomes?Where God guides his camel to stop,there he will build his house.All agreed?We turn Quaswa, his camel looseand where Quaswa sits, the Prophet stays.Clever man.A choice made by acamel can offend no one.Here we will buildthe house of the Prophet.And our first meetingplace, a prayer house!The first mosque of Islam, here!God is great! God is great!What is the prophet of God doing?Carrying bricks?Give me that.Look, you are doing too much.Please, go and sit down...we'll do it.Look! He went for more.\"Work is a worship\" he says.He's 53 years old.How old are you?There is something missing.Maybe a bell to call the people in.- The Christians use a bell?- Mmm (yes).What about a horn, like the Jews?A drum?There's too much blood in a drum.Why not the human voice...as in Umar ibn Khattab's vision?The Prophet agrees?He means you, Bilal.Me?You have a good voice, use it.Climb up there.Brothers!Today, a man of Medina,will embrace a man of Mecca.Each will share half and half.Reach out, embrace yourneighbor and brother.I'm tired of the politics ofkissing slaves, read this!The prophet should concernhimself with the after-world.How is my son?Praying like a horse.Does it burn your hands?If it's not torn up,it will burn down the house.He's making laws like a king.He has declared that loyalty to Islamis more than loyalty to tribal family.What?All muslims are next of kin to one-another?Don't be mislead by that.They must change thenature of the tribes before that.The danger is here, equality:a man's neighbour is as good as himself.The lunatic means it!Jews and Christians haveequal rights with Muslims.The Jews who attach themselves to acommon wealth shall be protected.- Women have rights of inheritance?- Rights.Next, he'll be giving the camel rights.He has! The lunatic has!You can't overload them.He's remaking a city, my city!Damn him!He's taken our sons from us,our future from us.His rights... are wrongs!No more.This time... it willnot be just his riffraff.We will take everything ofvalue they have left in Mecca.Their rugs, their houses, their silver...and with it, a large of caravan to Damascus.My friends, listen to me!I have news from Mecca!Everything you have left behind is gone!The thieves!Abu Bakr's shops,the prophet's house... sold!Every cup or piece of cloth,every rag or bone you everowned is thrown on the market.You are a people of nothing.Don't you even fight for what you own?Who talks of the fight?What other way is there, Hamza?When the Prophetsays fight, we fight.Now he says, peace.Exactly!You are a peace loving people!Up to your necks and fore-bearers.Go back to work.We have to defend ourselves.You are the messenger of God.Yet, they mock...abuse and plunder usand we do nothing.In the package of war, we are pathetic!But they are led by greed.We are led by God...and you.Now I...I know how you hate the sword,but we have to fight.They have stolen our property.They are taking it to Damascus,right past our own door.I say by God, get back!I'm sorry I'm carried away.It's the pounding in my head.Please... fight them!But... look at the sun.It's not the time for prayer.It is newly revealedby God to his messenger.Fight, but fight in the way of God,against those who fight against you.Drive them out of the placeswhere they drove you out,for persecution is worse than slaughter.Fight them until persecution is no moreand religion is for God.But if they stop,let there be no more war...for God never lovesthe starter of wars.So, fight in the way of Godagainst those who fight against you!- God is great!- God is great!! God is great!!- God is great!- God is great!!These are the disciplinesthe Prophet puts upon you.You may not harm a woman,a child or any old person!You may not harm cripples!You may not harm theman that works in the field!You may not cut down trees!Strike only at those who have expelled you!Who have stolen your rights andriched themselves with your possessions!Now, to the wells of Badr!News from Medina!Arm... arm yourselves!Arm yourselves!Defend your wealth!Muhammad has come out of Medinato attack the great caravan!- How many men?- Three hundred, two horses.We man a 100 horses.How many camels?- Seventy.- We'll bring a hundred and seventy!And load twenty of my camelswith wine, we'll make a feast of it.This is a war I'd like to fight,a war we cannot lose!Ride to Abu Sofyan's caravan,tell him to turn towards Badr.We will join our forcestomorrow at the wells of Badr.The wells of Badr, here.Muhammad's march, here.My charge of the caravan, here.One day's march...meet them at the wells.I don't like it.There is too much of Meccain my caravan to be risked.Put out the fires!Hold the camels!We are turning west,away from the wells.Away?You can't!You must meet them at Badr.We can drink them down like raw eggs.If I run all night, I'll be out ofMuhammad's reach by morning.Where is your honor, Abu Sofyan?!Honor?My honor is on thebacks of my camels.Yes, I run...Muhammad has occupied the wells!He has moved directlyinto our line of march.Abu Sofyan has broken camp.He's moving west, away from Badr.The caravan is safe.So, there is no need to fight.Not fight?If we fight, we will startblood feuds between brothers.Between father and son, you mean.Hudayfa, your own son is with them,he should have been whipped.Mecca is greater than your family!Waleed, your second son,he is your true blood.I say: fight!We stand in the presentlet the future look after itself.Otba is not a coward.We finish them tomorrow.- We fight!- We fight!!!Are you finished?!Form ranks, battle positions!Each man to his own place!Go back to your columns!Move away... move back!So Muhammad's filled the wells.Now everyone brought herewill have to fight, for theirs.Good, we fight!Brothers, we hold the wells.We stand in the name ofGod and his messenger.We wait.Send us your champions!(BATTLE OF BADR)Who are you?!We expect our peersand our equals!Come back!My brother, Shaiba!My son, Waleed!And myself!Not you.Ubaida and I...and Ali.Are we your equals?There is only one Godand Muhammad is His messenger.Archers!

They arefighting with the sky.They'll get what they want.They want Mecca.They'll get Mecca.When we see the stars at noon...Don't underestimate them,I've learned that to my cost.My friend, Mecca ismore than their home.It's where God spoke to man.Mecca is like a...homesickness to the soul.This year they're going as pilgrims.What?!Unarmed.Unarmed?Abu Sofyan will slaughterthem in the desert.If you believe in God as they do,it might be possiblenot to get slaughtered.But I agree with you,they probably will be.Be still!Do not let them provoke you,that is what they want!Stand firm!Peace be to you.The Prophet says: All who love Godmust renew their oaths to him.Under the tree!They've sent someone else.It's Suheil!That means we mightcome to an agreement.Muhammad, you have beengiven conditions of trucebetween yourself and Mecca.Have you agreed to them yet?What is this?In the name of God, the most gracious...Who is this new Godthey call, gracious?I do not know him,strike him out.And I cannot agree with this...\"Muhammad, the messenger of God?\"If I have thought youwere the messenger of God,I would not have fought you.Make it, \"Muhammad, the son of Abdullahagrees with Suhayl, the son of Amr.\"That is more factual.Well, so I understand.Good, that is better.Now, it is agreed...that you do notcontinue your pilgrimage,you must turn around and go home.Mecca is home.However...you may continue yourpilgrimage next year,and for 3 days only,in and out.We also agree to thetruce, for 10 years.During that time,you will not attack any tribe,or ambush any caravan,or any individual associatedwith us and vice versa.If you injure any oneof us, the truce ends......and vice versa.Is that clear?Ten years, ten years of peace.We need that time.We will use that time.These letters, from Muhammad,messenger of God,to the rulers of the world......call the world to Islam!To Heraclius, Emperor of Byzantium,Kisra, Emperor of Persia,Muqawqis, Patriarch of Alexandria.God go with you!God is great! God is great! God is great!There are no different races in Islam.An Arab is not superior to a foreigner.Nor a white man superior to a black.All return equally to God.Unless you desire for your neighbour,what you desire for yourself......you don't have faith.A man goes to bed with his belly full,while his neighbor is hungry......he isn't a Muslim.The Ink of a scholar is holierthan the blood of a martyr.A man reading is handsomein the sight of God.So, learn to read.And when you have learned......teach!The people of the book,the Jews with their Bible,the Christians with their testament,must be respected by you.For their books likewisecame from God.You must not think ofMuhammad as more than a man.He was collecting firewood one day.\"Let me do it,\" I said.\"Why?\" he said.\"You are the prophet of God!\"\"You can't go aroundscratching for firewood.\"But he looked at me, mumbling,\"God does not like the man who considershimself above other men,\" he said.So, I laid back and watched him.Suddenly, he stopped.He stood to his fullheight and came to me.\"Yes, I am the prophet of God,\" he said.\"But even I do not knowwhat will become of me.\"Amr, have you come to take me again?No.I have come to ask you to take me.I witness that there is only one God,and that Muhammad is His messenger.May God forgive me the timesI have fought against you.Islam does away withall that went before it.I'm sorry, I came in here wearing...Here are my jewels.What they are worth......I give to the poor.- And may I offer you my...- Yes.But you were thebitterest sword against Islam.Now by the will of God......I will be the raised sword of God.Ah, its all easy to God.Just as he makes dying living,he can make losing winning.Two years ago we thought we werebeaten when we had to sign that truce.Look at us now.Charging from victory tovictory in the hearts of men.What's that?Abu Sofyan is coming!Abu Sofyan!Why am I insulted like this?I'm Abu Sofyan!I expect some courtesy!We are not at war,we have a truce!I have come to speak toMuhammad, where is he?He is in the mosque.Muhammad, we did not break the truce.I have come to reaffirm the truce.I speak for Mecca.Muhammad, why do you turn from me?Don't go.Muhammad, don't go!Bedouins broke the truce, not us!The night was dark!I am here to testify,the night was dark!Barra, Barra this is your city!Hudayfa, you are my kin,aim to see for me!I must be heard!I am Mecca!I am the leader of Mecca!Why am I insulted like this?!Because you keep no promiseand respect no pledge.I have heard whatI never thought I'd hear:Abu Sofyan asking for pity.To be outfought, outfought,outmaneuvered by a one-time shepherd!You saw that shepherd'sreligion grow from a speck.Speck was in my eye...I could see nothing.Tell Mecca their gods are dead.It is useless to resist God.Travel fast, or every man herewill be close behind you.It's you who have broken the truce.For tonight will be ten thousand,men from every tribe.Now we can fight them, you are back.We will close the streets,and defend from the houses.It's no use.There are thousands of them,every hour they are joined by more.You coward!Hind, go home!You coward!Are you the leader of Mecca?!Look at yourself!You are broke, they swallowedyou and spat you back!Did my father and brother die,for my husband to run away?!You go home! You!We can not resist! Mecca is taken.No, no!We are to camp here for the night.I can see Mecca, eventhrough the mountains.So many fires, I cannot count them.It's very beautiful.When we drove them out of Mecca,I did not know theycarried Mecca with them.We can smell the bread they're baking.Yes, it means they don't intend to plunder,at least I hope that's what it means.They don't want blood ontheir own walls and doorsteps.I can bargain with that.Take me to him.So you are giving us the city?You offer me no bread.I understand.You may decide to kill me.Say what you have come to say.I saw your fires,the men around them,and I know what poweryou put into your men.We can no longer resist Muhammad.Now if you'll agree.You dare to come hereand ask for conditions?Isn't it time yet for you torecognize who Muhammad is?Muhammad, there isstill doubt in my heart.If I were to cut off your head,it would remove all your doubts.Khalid,there's no compulsion in religion.A man may take many yearsor only need minutes.It's God who decides the time.So respect his doubts.You're a black slave,you are the best school.I am only what God has given me.Yes.The gods that I worshipped,they don't have any use.It would have helped me.I declare, under no compulsion:there is one God,and you are the messenger of God.Now, let me go.Get inside!No doors may be broken down,nothing plundered, nothing seized!No one abused!All behind closed doors are safe!All in Abu Sofyan's house are safe!All by the Kaaba are safe!At least he kept his word,they haven't forced a door.He's stolen hearts, not walls.It's a permanent victory.I dread going out.We must, we must at the end.Were we so wrong?The way we lived,yes, that was wrong.We were trapped in our own faults.Our gods were less than us.Now there he is, makinghis entrance to the Kaaba.In the name of God,most gracious, most merciful.God gave this house toAbraham to be a sacred place.Worship no other gods but Himand cleanse his house.So it was.Muhammad took norevenge and allowed none.He declared Mecca a holy place.No one may shed bloodor cut down a tree,or kill a living thing in Mecca.Soon, all Arabia was converted. Not only to the new worshipbut to the new laws, manners,attitudes contained in Islam.The Prophet had livedto see his work done,but now he began tofeel the nearness of death.One great act of hisprophethood remained,the setting of it's seal.He called the people to himand he spoke for the last timeHis message of surrender to Godand humanity to man.''Oh, mankind! Listen well!\"\"I may not be with you much longer.\"\"The weak among you,feed them on what you eat.\"\"Dress them as you are dressed.\"\"You will meet your God,\"\"and He will call you toaccount for your actions.\"\"Let those who are presentwarn those who are absent.\"\"You are all are descendant from Adam,\"\"and the best among youis he who most regards God.\"\"Think deeply about what I say.\"\"Let all your feuds be abolished.\"\"You must know that every Muslimis the brother of every other Muslim.\"\"And all Muslims arebrothers one of another.\"\"Between Muslims, thereare no races and no tribes.\"\"Nor must you takeanything from your brother,\"\"except what is given freely.\"\"Do not oppressand do not be oppressed.\"\"O my people,\"\"I am but a man.\"\"It may be that the angelof death will visit me soon,\"\"and death will overtake me.\"\"But I have left you a book,\"\"revealed by God, the Quran,\"\"which is light and guidance.\"Now he repeated to the peoplethe final revelation of the Quran,the seal and termination,not Muhammad's words,but God's word:''This day I have perfectedyour religion for you\"\"and completed my favour to you\"\"and I've chosen for youIslam as your religion.''On June the 8th, 632,in his 63rd year,Muhammad died.Many of his followerscould not believe the fact.How can such a man die?But Abu Bakr, the Prophet's friendstood up in the mosque:\"If anyone worships Muhammad,\"\"let him know that Muhammad is dead.\"\"But he who worships God,\"\"let him know that Godis alive and can not die.''They buried Muhammadbeside his mosque, in Medina.But the religion he preachedfound it's place in the heart of man.It endured. It multiplied.Still to Mecca they come, mankind.The people of Islamdressed in their pilgrim white.All equal before God,all united in this place of prayer.Each individual soul joinedin a community of worship:\"ONE GOD\" Synced By JiSiNPlease rate this subtitle at other users to choose the best subtitles\n"

Almost there.MAN:Five, four, three, two...[Fanfare plays]Good morning.Last week it was announcedby the prison authoritiesthat the new governor of theriot-torn prison Barfieldwas to be Helen Hewitt.Miss Hewitt has joined usin the studio today.- Good morning to you, Helen.- Morning.At 33, you arethe youngest woman governorin charge ofan all-male category B prison.Yes, that's correct.And as if that weren'tenough of a challenge,you'll also be overseeingthe government's plansfor the refurbishmentof Barfield.Yes, I am.Now, the press believethat your appointmentmay have beena publicity stunt...I do not believethat my appointmentwas in any waya publicity-seeking campaignby the prison services.Also joining us this morningis Sarah Smith.Sarah, you feel very differentlyabout criminals, don't you?Eight years ago,I was raped and muggedonly a few yardsfrom my own home.I sustained injuries to my spineand have been unable to walkany distance since.My house was recently burgled,although the police doubtedif the two crimeswere connected.I was unable to dealwith the terror that he had...the man who raped me,had come back.There was a reason for that,wasn't there?Yes, he threatened me.He said he knew where I livedand he would alwaysbe able to find me.And you connected the burglarywith the rapist?Yes, I did.You see, by that timehe'd already been releasedfrom his prison.WOMAN:And how did this make you feel?Angry. Very angry!I live with a life sentence,not him.I just want to knowthat he's locked upand unable to hurtand abuse another woman.Miss Hewitt, do you believethat more government supportis given to the criminalthan to the victim?Every victimhas a right to justice.Of course they do.But that is not my job.That is the jobof the law courts.My job is to ensure that theperpetrators are rehabilitatedso that when they leave prison,they are no longera threat to society.SMITH:But it doesn't work.The man who raped meraped another womansix months after his release.Well, considering the costto keep a prisonerin luxury today,it's not surprising...Why doesn't the governmentspend more money on the victimsand not the criminals?The main costs areto ensure total security,so that a prisoner cannot escapeand endanger the public.I-I do understandand feel for the victims,such as Miss Smith,and of course,they should be cared for,but there areat this present timeover 50,000 men in prison.We cannot operatea \"lock them upand throw away the key\" regime,which achievesabsolutely nothing.We must at all costsrehabilitate themso that they do not reoffend.Sarah, did you receiveany compensation?Â£2,500.Â£2,500.It's a very small amountin comparisonwith the estimated Â£40 millionworth of damage doneduring the recent riotsat Barfield.Surely if the intentionwas to rehabilitatethe men held there,then it failed.The comfort, or thesoftly, softly\" approach...I've no intention of applyinga soft approachto my term as governor.In today's paperit was announcedthat Barfield has been allocatedÂ£60 million for the rebuild.Surely this isan astronomical amount of money.I have not been informedas to the exact amountto be allocated to Barfield.Really?It was in The Independent today.Perhaps this is an indicationof mismanagement.Sadly, yet again, the victimsof crime seem to be the losers.Was anyone at Barfield informed?MAN: Yes. There wase-mail notification.How could it possiblyget leaked to the presswithout prior consultationwith me?I can't say, but it musthave come from HQ.I would like to see those plans.Yes, I know youare my area manager,but don't you think that sinceI am the governor in charge,I may possibly havesome suggestions?I'll arrange it.As you're in London,say, half an hour?That's absolutely fine.I'll be there.Has anyone from Barfieldbeen shown these designs?I really wouldn't know.I'm just the architect.Well, it would make senseto ask people working therefor their input, wouldn't it?Well, I have only had dealingswith the prison authorities.The new priorityis to be the plumbing.Stainless steel toiletsand wash basins to each cell.These men spend 12 hours a dayinside these cells.They also eatall of their meals in there.It is totally insanitary.What's this?A proposed football pitch.AstroTurf.AstroTurf?Well, no wonderit's costing 60 million.This a swimming pool, is it?This is proposed to be builtinside the new larger perimeter,and is a complete secure unit.Is it an SSU or a control unit?A sort of prisonwithin the prison.[Cellphone rings]You mean a secure unit,Mr. Greenleaves.In America,it is nicknamed the \"cage,\"but from your design,it resemblesa four-star YMCA hostel.- Yes.- Miss Hewitt?- Speaking.- [Speaking indistinctly]No, I don't carewhat his solicitor says.I want Maynard cuffed to anofficer throughout that hearing.MAN: Without more timewe were unableto accommodate your request.What the hellam I paying you two for?There's no way they can freezethose accounts, is there?Mr. Maynard, it's gonebeyond that stage.- You're being charged.- I'm a declared bankrupt.They can charge mewith what the hell they like.How much? Hey?Now, come on, you two.How muchare they trying to get me for?It's not just the Inland Revenueand value added tax.Transporting anythingis a very costly business.Well, there must be a wayto salvage the original plan.I don't care what it costs.Now, look, this building hereis under construction.And this one too.Now, are you telling methat there's no wayto get access to this area?We might get 'round it,but it will cost.WOMAN: Mr. Maynard is solicitedto court two.- Are they ready for the hearing?- Yes, sir.Oh!Trying to clean me out.Let's go.There's no way that we can, uh,get rid of these forthe hearing, is there, you know?I mean, they knowI've been nicked, you know?No need to overplay your hand,you know,and lose the sympathy vote,is there?How much?Five grand? Ten?No? 20?Final offer... 30 large.[Chuckles]Just joking.Can you do it?I'm gonna have to findone hell of a pilot.- Mr. Morgan...- Later, son.You must be the new ladfrom Pentonville.I'm the senior officeron C Wing.- Russell Morgan.- James Malahide. Jimmy.So, what made you sign up, then?I was in the services.Couldn't settle into civvies.My wife's just had a baby.Ah, 14 years 3 Para, me.A period is one hour,9:30 to 10:30.We keep them coming.Unless it rains.Good morning, Stanley.Your governor coming back then,is he?Why, yours not?Did you see heron TV this morning?Not exactly what you'd call\"Baywatch\" material, is she?[Laughs]That's Edward Maynard's runner.Carries all his messagesbackwards and forwards,sort of like a ferret.Other chap is Harry Reynolds,lifer.Cigarette?You know who I am.Ex-RAF, aren't you?Mr. Maynard needs some advice.Do you reckon Maynardwill come back?Yeah.These big motherslook after Maynard.Day off for them today.- Mr. Morgan.- I said later, son.That's Roddy Marsh.He ate his grandmother,didn't he?Aye.He's a vegetarian now.- There's the nonces!- Perverts![Indistinct shouting]Perverts!Come on, old man!Pervert!What's your problem?You've got a pad thief,Mr. Morgan, on C Wing.All right, son.We'll settle it.Go on, then.You watch your step, Marky.Good morning, Governor!Big breakfast go all right,then, did it?[Chuckles]- What's with that guy?- Oh, he's harmless enough.Just keeps ongetting over the wall.We've got to keep himin the sheltered areatill he learns some sense.Don't they have those stripesin Pentonville, then?Oh, yeah. Just neverseen them used, that's all.Oh, you don't see themused much these days.Bloody prison watchdogs reckonthey're too humiliating.Yeah, but I was told thatthere'd be no lossof me privileges,just 21 days punishment.Hang about.You're doing four years, right?- Yeah.- You lost 21 days.So you're telling me you'regoing out on your old date?Yeah, man.But what about you doing chokeyfor head-butting that screw?You get 21 days, right?Yeah, they just saidme time went on pause.Well, if your time went onpause, when did it start again?When I got back to me pad.No way.You got 21 days extra.They got to be doubled.You sure about that?How long would he have?I don't know.Piss off!There's money in this for you.Get it sent to your wife.You sure it'd take 20 minutesbefore the scream went up?Night the riot went down,40 minutes.I'd go for it.[Coughs]- What's happened to you?- It's my wisdom tooth.It's been throbbing all night,and now it's started bleeding.All right, let's have a look.Come on, open up.Which one?All right, Howard,we'll get it fixed.Go on, son.Scarper.Now, look, if you're right,and you say your timedid not go on pause,and you say none of yourprivileges were taken away,you should be entitled to them.Yeah.But they usually put themat the end of your EDR.So if you got three months,well, where did they put them?Frigging push me!I don't know.Piss off.What you've got to dois ask them to explain.Ask the S.O.Mr. Morgan, can I have a word?Inside, Brian.Go on.So, now you've met some ofthe players, what do you think?Okay.I think I can handle it.Mr. Morgan, there's somethinggoing down... big.- I think it's a delivery.- Bugger off, son.Welcome to Barfield.C Wing S.O.has made a dental appointmentfor prisoner Howard Webster,4:00 this afternoon.Anything you need.Thought you were very goodthis morning.I didn't.Oh, Mavis, um, was there anykind of press release from HQ?I'll check the fax machine.Everything okay?You missed your roundsthis morning.Mr. Lyons isn't here, but I'veshown young Malahide the ropes.Big of aggro going down, and...Oh, he's the, um,the new officer?Yep.

They're gonnaspend 60 million on this place?I really have no idea.It was in The Independent.We recordedthe breakfast show in the club.I bet you did, Mr. Morgan.I had five phone cards.And Mark, next pad,he asked me if he can borrowone of my phone cards.I tell him no because I knowhe won't pay me for it.Right?I come back from associationlast night,and my pad's been cleaned out.And this morning, on exercise,I heard a rumorthat somebody in D Winghas been offered one,and someone in thiswing's been offered one too.It's really got me down,Miss Hewitt.I mean, that Game Boy's worthat least 15 phone cards.All right, Jack.I'll see what I can do.But you know it's againstprison regulationsto do these trade-offs.Okay?[Sighs]Now, Webster.You've made hima 4:00 p.m. dental appointment.MORGAN: That's right.- Morning, Gov.- Morning.- Morning, Gov.- Uh, morning.What time's Dr. Thomas due?2:00.But Webster needs a dentist.I think we should have a newarrangement with the doctor.I mean, as thingsstand at the moment,if the inmates want to see him,they have to wait until 2:00.So?It clasheswith their visiting times.If they have to see the doc,then they miss their visit,and they won't miss their visit.Okay.

Almost there.MAN:Five, four, three, two...[Fanfare plays]Good morning.Last week it was announcedby the prison authoritiesthat the new governor of theriot-torn prison Barfieldwas to be Helen Hewitt.Miss Hewitt has joined usin the studio today.- Good morning to you, Helen.- Morning.At 33, you arethe youngest woman governorin charge ofan all-male category B prison.Yes, that's correct.And as if that weren'tenough of a challenge,you'll also be overseeingthe government's plansfor the refurbishmentof Barfield.Yes, I am.Now, the press believethat your appointmentmay have beena publicity stunt...I do not believethat my appointmentwas in any waya publicity-seeking campaignby the prison services.Also joining us this morningis Sarah Smith.Sarah, you feel very differentlyabout criminals, don't you?Eight years ago,I was raped and muggedonly a few yardsfrom my own home.I sustained injuries to my spineand have been unable to walkany distance since.My house was recently burgled,although the police doubtedif the two crimeswere connected.I was unable to dealwith the terror that he had...the man who raped me,had come back.There was a reason for that,wasn't there?Yes, he threatened me.He said he knew where I livedand he would alwaysbe able to find me.And you connected the burglarywith the rapist?Yes, I did.You see, by that timehe'd already been releasedfrom his prison.WOMAN:And how did this make you feel?Angry. Very angry!I live with a life sentence,not him.I just want to knowthat he's locked upand unable to hurtand abuse another woman.Miss Hewitt, do you believethat more government supportis given to the criminalthan to the victim?Every victimhas a right to justice.Of course they do.But that is not my job.That is the jobof the law courts.My job is to ensure that theperpetrators are rehabilitatedso that when they leave prison,they are no longera threat to society.SMITH:But it doesn't work.The man who raped meraped another womansix months after his release.Well, considering the costto keep a prisonerin luxury today,it's not surprising...Why doesn't the governmentspend more money on the victimsand not the criminals?The main costs areto ensure total security,so that a prisoner cannot escapeand endanger the public.I-I do understandand feel for the victims,such as Miss Smith,and of course,they should be cared for,but there areat this present timeover 50,000 men in prison.We cannot operatea \"lock them upand throw away the key\" regime,which achievesabsolutely nothing.We must at all costsrehabilitate themso that they do not reoffend.Sarah, did you receiveany compensation?2,500.2,500.It's a very small amountin comparisonwith the estimated 40 millionworth of damage doneduring the recent riotsat Barfield.Surely if the intentionwas to rehabilitatethe men held there,then it failed.The comfort, or thesoftly, softly\" approach...I've no intention of applyinga soft approachto my term as governor.In today's paperit was announcedthat Barfield has been allocated60 million for the rebuild.Surely this isan astronomical amount of money.I have not been informedas to the exact amountto be allocated to Barfield.Really?It was in The Independent today.Perhaps this is an indicationof mismanagement.Sadly, yet again, the victimsof crime seem to be the losers.Was anyone at Barfield informed?MAN: Yes. There wase-mail notification.How could it possiblyget leaked to the presswithout prior consultationwith me?I can't say, but it musthave come from HQ.I would like to see those plans.Yes, I know youare my area manager,but don't you think that sinceI am the governor in charge,I may possibly havesome suggestions?I'll arrange it.As you're in London,say, half an hour?That's absolutely fine.I'll be there.Has anyone from Barfieldbeen shown these designs?I really wouldn't know.I'm just the architect.Well, it would make senseto ask people working therefor their input, wouldn't it?Well, I have only had dealingswith the prison authorities.The new priorityis to be the plumbing.Stainless steel toiletsand wash basins to each cell.These men spend 12 hours a dayinside these cells.They also eatall of their meals in there.It is totally insanitary.What's this?A proposed football pitch.AstroTurf.AstroTurf?Well, no wonderit's costing 60 million.This a swimming pool, is it?This is proposed to be builtinside the new larger perimeter,and is a complete secure unit.Is it an SSU or a control unit?A sort of prisonwithin the prison.[Cellphone rings]You mean a secure unit,Mr. Greenleaves.In America,it is nicknamed the \"cage,\"but from your design,it resemblesa four-star YMCA hostel.- Yes.- Miss Hewitt?- Speaking.- [Speaking indistinctly]No, I don't carewhat his solicitor says.I want Maynard cuffed to anofficer throughout that hearing.MAN: Without more timewe were unableto accommodate your request.What the hellam I paying you two for?There's no way they can freezethose accounts, is there?Mr. Maynard, it's gonebeyond that stage.- You're being charged.- I'm a declared bankrupt.They can charge mewith what the hell they like.How much? Hey?Now, come on, you two.How muchare they trying to get me for?It's not just the Inland Revenueand value added tax.Transporting anythingis a very costly business.Well, there must be a wayto salvage the original plan.I don't care what it costs.Now, look, this building hereis under construction.And this one too.Now, are you telling methat there's no wayto get access to this area?We might get 'round it,but it will cost.WOMAN: Mr. Maynard is solicitedto court two.- Are they ready for the hearing?- Yes, sir.Oh!Trying to clean me out.Let's go.There's no way that we can, uh,get rid of these forthe hearing, is there, you know?I mean, they knowI've been nicked, you know?No need to overplay your hand,you know,and lose the sympathy vote,is there?How much?Five grand? Ten?No? 20?Final offer... 30 large.[Chuckles]Just joking.Can you do it?I'm gonna have to findone hell of a pilot.- Mr. Morgan...- Later, son.You must be the new ladfrom Pentonville.I'm the senior officeron C Wing.- Russell Morgan.- James Malahide.

Just neverseen them used, that's all.Oh, you don't see themused much these days.Bloody prison watchdogs reckonthey're too humiliating.Yeah, but I was told thatthere'd be no lossof me privileges,just 21 days punishment.Hang about.You're doing four years, right?- Yeah.- You lost 21 days.So you're telling me you'regoing out on your old date?Yeah, man.But what about you doing chokeyfor head-butting that screw?You get 21 days, right?Yeah, they just saidme time went on pause.Well, if your time went onpause, when did it start again?When I got back to me pad.No way.You got 21 days extra.They got to be doubled.You sure about that?How long would he have?I don't know.Piss off!There's money in this for you.Get it sent to your wife.You sure it'd take 20 minutesbefore the scream went up?Night the riot went down,40 minutes.I'd go for it.[Coughs]- What's happened to you?- It's my wisdom tooth.It's been throbbing all night,and now it's started bleeding.All right, let's have a look.Come on, open up.Which one?All right, Howard,we'll get it fixed.Go on, son.Scarper.Now, look, if you're right,and you say your timedid not go on pause,and you say none of yourprivileges were taken away,you should be entitled to them.Yeah.But they usually put themat the end of your EDR.So if you got three months,well, where did they put them?Frigging push me!I don't know.Piss off.What you've got to dois ask them to explain.Ask the S.O.Mr. Morgan, can I have a word?Inside, Brian.Go on.So, now you've met some ofthe players, what do you think?Okay.I think I can handle it.Mr. Morgan, there's somethinggoing down... big.- I think it's a delivery.- Bugger off, son.Welcome to Barfield.C Wing S.O.has made a dental appointmentfor prisoner Howard Webster,4:00 this afternoon.Anything you need.Thought you were very goodthis morning.I didn't.Oh, Mavis, um, was there anykind of press release from HQ?I'll check the fax machine.Everything okay?You missed your roundsthis morning.Mr. Lyons isn't here, but I'veshown young Malahide the ropes.Big of aggro going down, and...Oh, he's the, um,the new officer?Yep.

Almost there.MAN:Five, four, three, two...[Fanfare plays]Good morning.Last week it was announcedby the prison authoritiesthat the new governor of theriot-torn prison Barfieldwas to be Helen Hewitt.Miss Hewitt has joined usin the studio today.- Good morning to you, Helen.- Morning.At 33, you arethe youngest woman governorin charge ofan all-male category B prison.Yes, that's correct.And as if that weren'tenough of a challenge,you'll also be overseeingthe government's plansfor the refurbishmentof Barfield.Yes, I am.Now, the press believethat your appointmentmay have beena publicity stunt...I do not believethat my appointmentwas in any waya publicity-seeking campaignby the prison services.Also joining us this morningis Sarah Smith.Sarah, you feel very differentlyabout criminals, don't you?Eight years ago,I was raped and muggedonly a few yardsfrom my own home.I sustained injuries to my spineand have been unable to walkany distance since.My house was recently burgled,although the police doubtedif the two crimeswere connected.I was unable to dealwith the terror that he had...the man who raped me,had come back.There was a reason for that,wasn't there?Yes, he threatened me.He said he knew where I livedand he would alwaysbe able to find me.And you connected the burglarywith the rapist?Yes, I did.You see, by that timehe'd already been releasedfrom his prison.WOMAN:And how did this make you feel?Angry. Very angry!I live with a life sentence,not him.I just want to knowthat he's locked upand unable to hurtand abuse another woman.Miss Hewitt, do you believethat more government supportis given to the criminalthan to the victim?Every victimhas a right to justice.Of course they do.But that is not my job.That is the jobof the law courts.My job is to ensure that theperpetrators are rehabilitatedso that when they leave prison,they are no longera threat to society.SMITH:But it doesn't work.The man who raped meraped another womansix months after his release.Well, considering the costto keep a prisonerin luxury today,it's not surprising...Why doesn't the governmentspend more money on the victimsand not the criminals?The main costs areto ensure total security,so that a prisoner cannot escapeand endanger the public.I-I do understandand feel for the victims,such as Miss Smith,and of course,they should be cared for,but there areat this present timeover 50,000 men in prison.We cannot operatea \"lock them upand throw away the key\" regime,which achievesabsolutely nothing.We must at all costsrehabilitate themso that they do not reoffend.Sarah, did you receiveany compensation?2,500.2,500.It's a very small amountin comparisonwith the estimated 40 millionworth of damage doneduring the recent riotsat Barfield.Surely if the intentionwas to rehabilitatethe men held there,then it failed.The comfort, or thesoftly, softly\" approach...I've no intention of applyinga soft approachto my term as governor.In today's paperit was announcedthat Barfield has been allocated60 million for the rebuild.Surely this isan astronomical amount of money.I have not been informedas to the exact amountto be allocated to Barfield.Really?It was in The Independent today.Perhaps this is an indicationof mismanagement.Sadly, yet again, the victimsof crime seem to be the losers.Was anyone at Barfield informed?MAN: Yes. There wase-mail notification.How could it possiblyget leaked to the presswithout prior consultationwith me?I can't say, but it musthave come from HQ.I would like to see those plans.Yes, I know youare my area manager,but don't you think that sinceI am the governor in charge,I may possibly havesome suggestions?I'll arrange it.As you're in London,say, half an hour?That's absolutely fine.I'll be there.Has anyone from Barfieldbeen shown these designs?I really wouldn't know.I'm just the architect.Well, it would make senseto ask people working therefor their input, wouldn't it?Well, I have only had dealingswith the prison authorities.The new priorityis to be the plumbing.Stainless steel toiletsand wash basins to each cell.These men spend 12 hours a dayinside these cells.They also eatall of their meals in there.It is totally insanitary.What's this?A proposed football pitch.AstroTurf.AstroTurf?Well, no wonderit's costing 60 million.This a swimming pool, is it?This is proposed to be builtinside the new larger perimeter,and is a complete secure unit.Is it an SSU or a control unit?A sort of prisonwithin the prison.[Cellphone rings]You mean a secure unit,Mr. Greenleaves.In America,it is nicknamed the \"cage,\"but from your design,it resemblesa four-star YMCA hostel.- Yes.- Miss Hewitt?- Speaking.- [Speaking indistinctly]No, I don't carewhat his solicitor says.I want Maynard cuffed to anofficer throughout that hearing.MAN: Without more timewe were unableto accommodate your request.What the hellam I paying you two for?There's no way they can freezethose accounts, is there?Mr. Maynard, it's gonebeyond that stage.- You're being charged.- I'm a declared bankrupt.They can charge mewith what the hell they like.How much? Hey?Now, come on, you two.How muchare they trying to get me for?It's not just the Inland Revenueand value added tax.Transporting anythingis a very costly business.Well, there must be a wayto salvage the original plan.I don't care what it costs.Now, look, this building hereis under construction.And this one too.Now, are you telling methat there's no wayto get access to this area?We might get 'round it,but it will cost.WOMAN: Mr. Maynard is solicitedto court two.- Are they ready for the hearing?- Yes, sir.Oh!Trying to clean me out.Let's go.There's no way that we can, uh,get rid of these forthe hearing, is there, you know?I mean, they knowI've been nicked, you know?No need to overplay your hand,you know,and lose the sympathy vote,is there?How much?Five grand? Ten?No? 20?Final offer... 30 large.[Chuckles]Just joking.Can you do it?I'm gonna have to findone hell of a pilot.- Mr. Morgan...- Later, son.You must be the new ladfrom Pentonville.I'm the senior officeron C Wing.- Russell Morgan.- James Malahide.

Just neverseen them used, that's all.Oh, you don't see themused much these days.Bloody prison watchdogs reckonthey're too humiliating.Yeah, but I was told thatthere'd be no lossof me privileges,just 21 days punishment.Hang about.You're doing four years, right?- Yeah.- You lost 21 days.So you're telling me you'regoing out on your old date?Yeah, man.But what about you doing chokeyfor head-butting that screw?You get 21 days, right?Yeah, they just saidme time went on pause.Well, if your time went onpause, when did it start again?When I got back to me pad.No way.You got 21 days extra.They got to be doubled.You sure about that?How long would he have?I don't know.Piss off!There's money in this for you.Get it sent to your wife.You sure it'd take 20 minutesbefore the scream went up?Night the riot went down,40 minutes.I'd go for it.[Coughs]- What's happened to you?- It's my wisdom tooth.It's been throbbing all night,and now it's started bleeding.All right, let's have a look.Come on, open up.Which one?All right, Howard,we'll get it fixed.Go on, son.Scarper.Now, look, if you're right,and you say your timedid not go on pause,and you say none of yourprivileges were taken away,you should be entitled to them.Yeah.But they usually put themat the end of your EDR.So if you got three months,well, where did they put them?Frigging push me!I don't know.Piss off.What you've got to dois ask them to explain.Ask the S.O.Mr. Morgan, can I have a word?Inside, Brian.Go on.So, now you've met some ofthe players, what do you think?Okay.I think I can handle it.Mr. Morgan, there's somethinggoing down... big.- I think it's a delivery.- Bugger off, son.Welcome to Barfield.C Wing S.O.has made a dental appointmentfor prisoner Howard Webster,4:00 this afternoon.Anything you need.Thought you were very goodthis morning.I didn't.Oh, Mavis, um, was there anykind of press release from HQ?I'll check the fax machine.Everything okay?You missed your roundsthis morning.Mr. Lyons isn't here, but I'veshown young Malahide the ropes.Big of aggro going down, and...Oh, he's the, um,the new officer?Yep.

Why?For breaking and enteringthe city mortuary.Find Inspector Wellington.Duke, the door.Hmm.Duke.It's your house, you get it.Sorry to bother you,but I wondered if InspectorWellington was there.You've got a visitor.Inspector Wellington!I need your help.It's Eliza.She's been arrested.Tell her it's my day off.Who is this Eliza?She's not my wife.Ready inspector?Miss Scarlet reallydoes need your help.There's clearly been amisunderstanding Detective Phelps.Not that I wish to tellyou how to do your job.You being an extremelyexperienced, well regarded officer,I'm simply perplexed asto what has happened.Well, let me enlightenyou, Miss Scarlet.Last night someone smashed the windowof the city mortuary and broke in.They then gained accessto the clerical officeinside and stole somehighly confidential files.Well, if that is truethen it's both deplorableand a disgrace.Words shared by the clerkof the mortuary, Mr Potts,although in his case he used them todescribe you rather than the situation.I know that man's opinion of me.'An unscrupulous woman''who is as trustworthyas a bag of snakes'.The fact is, I'm no thief.So glad you brought upfacts, Miss Scarlet,because the factremains that your ringwas found at the crime scene.Well, I have no ideahow it got there.Women aren't even allowed inthe mortuary - quite right too.It's no place for a lady.Morning to you.I'll take you fromhere Detective Phelps.Thank God for that.I'm sorry to have draggedyou into this, William.On my day off.Oh. Were you doingsomething nice?I have no idea how my mother's ringfound its way to the crime scene.It's a puzzle indeed.Do you think I wasborn yesterday?I'm warning you, Eliza.The next words out of yourmouth better be the truthor I'll take you downto the cells myself.All right. I did go tothe mortuary yesterday.I have numerous outstandingcases which I could progress withif Mr Potts would share somebasic information with me.But he refuses to treat melike a fellow professional.So I have no choice but tobreak in like a common criminaland check the files myself.I must have dropped mymother's ring whilst there,hence this misunderstanding.So let me get this straight..Last night you brokeinto the city mortuaryand stole filesfrom Potts' office.Where exactly is themisunderstanding?I never stole anything.I looked at the filesand put them back.And it wasn't last night,it was yesterday afternoonwhen Mr Potts was out for lunch.And I didn't break in.Why would I want to have a key?You duplicated a keyfor the city mortuary?What choice do I have?Someone else broke into the mortuarylast night and it wasn't me.I wouldn't lie to you, William.That's a blatant lie in itself.Miss Scarlet.- Detective Fitzroy.New haircut?Very smart.Sir, I have a message for you.I thought I told you I wasn'there. I'm on my day off.Yes Sir, but the Superintendenthas asked for you.He says it's urgent.Do not move.William.William..You do believe me, don't you?This is an extremely seriousoffence that you're accused of.It's going to be damn hardto prove it wasn't you.Come in!Ah, Wellington. Thisis Mr Thackeray.Good morning, sir.I hope it is a goodmorning, Inspector..It's been a bloody awful night,that's for sure.Mr Thackery isthe chief coroner.The break in at city mortuary?Break ins.Plural. We've just had word thatthe mortuaries in Kentish Townand Swiss Cottage werebroken into last night.Confidential filesstolen from each.I believe you have theperpetrator in custody.We do indeed, Edmund.That woman has a historyof breaking the law.My man in the city has had todeal with her time and time again,but this timeshe's gone too far.The lady detective..What nonsense.So Miss Scarlet has had someminor grievances with the clerkwho runs the citymortuary service.There was evidence foundat one of the crime scenesthat places her there.Surely you are workingunder the assumptionthat whoever did one break inmust have done the other two.Yes, that would bethe assumption, sir.I want that womancharged without delay.It's all in hand.Take Miss Scarlet directly toHolloway. She can be kept there whilstfurther investigationsare undertaken.Further Investgation? Whatneed is there of that?You've got all theevidence you need. Fergus.Charge her.- But Sir..That's an order, Inspector.Yes, Sir.Sorry, Eliza.Where is she?I wish I knew so I couldgive her a piece of my mind.She does nothing butworry the life out of me.Not only is she now a fugitive,but she's also made acomplete fool out of me again.I'm as frantic tofind her as you are.God knows where she is.God knows what danger she's in.Well, not as much danger as she'llbe when I get my hands on her.Please do not talklike that Inspector,it's not gentlemanly.Do you have any idea howmuch trouble she's in?Then you must help her.How can I when I don'tknow where she is?There was one person whomight know her whereaboutsand I have my men huntinghim down as we speak.If Moses so much as sneezes,we will be down on himlike a ton of bricks.What makes you thinkMoses knows anything?Those two are thick as thieves?If you see her oryou hear from her,then you send forme Ivy, immediately.Are you sure youweren't followed?Why do peoplealways ask me that?I'm worried about my girl.Are you certain this isthe right thing to do?Just stick to the plan.I don't think I can do it.You just lied to theDetective Inspector.You can do this.Gone.Gone where?I don't know sir.So a prime suspect who was inyour custody has done a runner.You're unable tolocate her, a woman.She's a private detective, Sir.She has contacts..- Are you not one of them?I can assure you that I'vehad no hand in this, sir.I can also assure youthat Eliza Scarletis not the perpetrator. We'rebarking up the wrong tree.Enough!Now it seems to mewe have a conflictof interest here,so I'm going to recommendyou'll move to another case,With all due respect, Sir,that would be a mistake.The chief coroner's a manof connection and influence.Whose going to make mylife extremely difficult.Give me one more day, sir.Now, I have not long been in thisjob laddie and I can assure youyou do not want to bethe reason I lose it.You have your day.Find her!Yes, Sir.What a privilege it isto have such a visit.Not since Prince Albert himselfgraced us to openour new autopsy winghave I been so honoured.And the honour isall mine, Mr. Potts.I am merely here at the requestof my husband, Mr Thackery.'Cecilia', he said. 'Youmust pay Mr Potts a visit''and see is he quite well aftersuch a distressing episode'.The notion of the chief coronergiving an employee as lowly as myselfany thought is.. That'scomfort indeed, Mrs Thackery.But this business, with the break-inhas left me feeling somewhat violated.To think someonecame into this, myprivate sanctuarywithout authorization.I say someone, but I know exactlywho it was and so do the police.Yes, my husband toldme all about it.Some young woman, was it not?I hear she's a private investigator.What a curious job for a lady.There's nothing of thelady about that woman.What exactly was it she stole?I thought you said your husbandtold you all about it, Mrs Thackery?He did indeed, but..I have quite forgotten. Ah,you know how us ladies are..It's hard to retain too muchinformation at any one time.I do not believe you.It is abundantly clear to methat a lady such as yourselfpossesses great brainsas well as beauty.You're kind, Mr. Potts.But it is nevertheless true thatthe details have quite evaded me.Would you mind if we didnot discuss that woman?I have to be mindfulof my blood pressureand she has a habit ofcausing me great vexation.Tea.Goodness, I'd quite forgottenthe reason for my visit.My husband and I would liketo invite you for dinner.This evening.At the chief coroner's house?And I will endeavour to keepmy questions to a minimum.I'd hate to causeundue vexation.I... Mrs Thackery, nonsense...What is it you wish to know?Confidential files were stolenfrom all three mortuaries.They contained lists of unidentifiedbodies who died 25 years agoin the August of 1857.Anything else taken?We should let Eliza know.Not yet.She must lie low untilI've found out more.Where exactly is this safehouse she's holed up in?I hope it's respectable.It's not exactlyClaridges, but it will do.Oh my God.Miss Scarlet,welcome to my castle.I hope you've madeyourself home.Yes, yes.Moses has shown meall the amenities.Thank you for allowingme to shelter here.I have allegations made againstme that are completely false.Aren't they always?So what are thesefalse allegations?It's a break in atthe city mortuaryand for your informationthe claims are false.On Bow Lane?Mm..My sister Clementineworks that steet?Your sister's calledClementine, too?All my sisters are. Made it easy forour mother to remember who's who..If something happenedon my sister's patchshe'd know about it,'orrible though she is.I could pay her a visit though.See if she knows anything.I'd be most grateful.How grateful?I take great riskin going to see her.Last week she puncheda dog in the face.This Moses is the key.If anyone can leadus to her, it's him.Sir, I've got the informationthat you asked for.Get to it.Did I say something wrong, Sir?Shut the door first, Roy.Now, I do not believe thatMiss Scarlet is guilty in thisbut my orders are to find her,not to go looking foralternative perpetrators.So this line of inquiry is toremain strictly between us.You have a problemwith that detective?No, Sir.I do not have aproblem with that.Good.And what have you got for me?The files stolen from eachof the three mortuariescontain a list of unidentifiedbodies from August 1857.Yes, yes, tell mesomething I don't know.Then I searched for a link,male, female, similar ages,cause of death,but unfortunately those details only existin records at the cemeteries themselves,but I managed to findmaps of each cemeteryand where thegraves are located.I've marked them with an X.How many cemeteries are there?14 Sir, with onepauper grave in each.Shall I come with you, Sir?No, I need to do this quietly.Go back to your duties.Yes, Sir.Clementine, where have you been?You've been gone for hours.Did you see your sister?What did she say?Does she know anythingabout the break-in?Saw her.. very nice.. well..Whatever..Yeah, it wasn't very good since thewrestling match with our grandmother.She saw the real thief?Clementine..Clementine.Oh!You should beashamed of yourself.I'm calling the police!Stop.I'm a police officer, madam.Are you all right?Just a little shaken, myhusband's the vicar here.He's away on business.I'm all alone.Poor soul.Those grave robbers,they have no morals.Do you know who's buried here?No one knows.Pauper grave.I was in my parlourin the vicarage.I like to carry out mycorrespondence there.So, what alertedyou to the robbers?I was writing tomy sister Agatha,I heard a noise outside.We weren't expectingany burials today.My husband's awayon church business,staying with the Archbishophimself in CanterburySo you heard a noise outside?I went out to see what itwas and instantly I knew.Body snatchers. It's a lucrative tradeselling corpses to the medical profession.They supply bodiesfor anatomy classes.Dissections.Yes, I am aware of the practice.I shouted at them to stop.They was so shocked thatsomeone was at the vicarage.They must have assumed it empty.Then they saw you, a man..Had you not beenthere inspector..I dread to think whatmight have happened.You got a good look at them?One had dark hairand the other was..Fairer?Average build, the pair.Any scars, tattoosdistinguishing features?None that I saw butthey were very grubby.Dirt all over theirfaces, their hands.I'm sorry.I haven't been much help.No, you've been most helpful.See Mrs Ellis home.JakeThere's been asighting: the Jamaican.Do you want me to bring him in?No. He's mine.And a pound ofpotatoes, please Jim.Jim, right?Right you are, young lady.Mrs Thackery.How nice to see you again.Mr. Potts..What a small world?Not really. Mother isjust around the corner.Had to pay her visit toimpart my most wonderful news.Oh?The honour of dining with yourselfand the chief coroner this evening.I said mother, I might justpurchase a new tie for the occasion.This one's so special.Mother would so loveto have joined us.Well, bring heralong if you like.Mrs Thackery, youmisunderstand me..Mother is dead.It is her grave which I visit.I felt compelled to share the newsof this great honor bestowed upon me.Well, I really should be going.Dinner will not prepare itself.I am more than alittle confused.It's most unusual that a lady, suchas yourself, does her own shopping.Indeed, however,I wanted to ensurethat all the ingredients for tonight'sdinner were of the highest quality.I don't know what to say.Until this evening, then.Until this evening.What a delightful lady.It is a treat to be in hercompany. A treat indeed.Yeah, Ivy is one in a million.Ivy?Clementine,Clementine.I've just had theloveliest dream.Moses took me to Gilbert's, andmy God did he look handsome.What did your sisterClementine say?Which one - there's five of us?The one that witnessed thebreak-in in the city mortuary.Oh. Uh.. she said itwas raining that nightso she took shelter underthe arches near the mortuary.That's when she saw him him.- Him?A man.Yes, I've gathered thatbut what did he look like?Blackest of hair,bluest of eyes..A crooked smile that wouldmake the devil whimper.Did she recognise him?It's something I suppose.Man, black hair, blue eyes.You said she wassheltering from the rain.It wasn't raining that night.In fact, it hasn't rainedfor weeks and if it was dark,how did she seehe had blue eyes?She's got good eyesight.You said she hadonly one working eye.You didn't go and seeyour sister, did you?You drank my money.She's terrifyingWhen I was a girl she stole mypet mouse and baked it in a pot.I want my money back now.I'd love to stay and chatbut I've got to get to work.Where is she?Grave robbers drink here.I said where is she?Let me go in, ask around,see about those two whowere running from you.How do you know about that?You've been following me.You're going... forget it, theywill smell police a mile away.And why would youwant to help me?We both know she's innocentand those body snatcherswill lead to the real thief.So I will help you help her.For a fee, of course.I don't work with criminals.Shame Miss Scarletdoesn't follow my example.Good luck.You're gonna need it.Whiskey.There you go.Inspector.ElizaMr Potts..- Do not bother Miss Woods.It's your real name, is it not?Miss Ivy Woods.Yes. Yes it is.And I'm so sorry tohave deceived you.It was for a good reason.That's never a good reasonto deceive, Miss Woods.It comes as no surprise to methat the lady who runsthe house with that womanshould herself beunchristian in her ways.I can assure you I don'tmake a habit of lying.I love that girl and Ido anything to help her.I should never have believedthat the chief coronerwould even consider invitingsomeone like me for dinner.He'd think I'd know myplace in the world by now.And you haven'tlearned Barnabas..I really am very sorry Mr Potts.I've never done anythinglike this before.Hah!Take heart, Miss Woods.Because you had me fooled.Good day.Mr Potts, did you spendmoney on a new tie?Come on, cough up.I think I'll take a ladyout with my winnings.How about..Your mum?Who's there?I'm looking for aman about a job.The kind that can makeyou serious money.Is business good?Booming, mate. Be even better ifI weren't stuck with this ingrate.Get on with you.Take them to the cells.Keep them separate.I'll question this one first.I've done nothing!Shut your mouth!I do not like to be manhandled.Best part of myday, arresting you.We need it to look real.This was your idea.I got you your thief.Now it's your turn.Well, I'd like to say it was apleasure doing business with you,but you know I'd be lying.More where that came from, if youtell me where Miss Scarlet is.I'll be watching you.I'd expect nothingless, Inspector.Why is this Miss Scarletnot in prison as we speak?How has she evaded the entireMetropolitan Police force?I know it's notideal, but trust me.You had this woman hereand she slippedthrough your fingers.Well, I've had enough ofthis nonsense, Fergus.I'm taking this upwith your superiors.Edmund..- Out of my way.Sir, we have adevelopment in the case.You have the womanback in custody?No, Sir, I havesomething better.So just to confirm, this is not thewoman who hired you to rob the graveat Highgate Cemetery?She was much older.And this older woman is the sameas who you believe broke intothe three burgled mortuaries.How do you know this?Because these nicked filesthat you keep banging on about- she had them. Paid us todig up every name on there.When I say name thegraves didn't have any.All of them pauper graves.And what was she looking for?Not a bleeding clue.But whatever it wasall she found werebags of bones.So, what happened?Tell me about this woman.Name, age, appearance.I don't know her name.Only that they call herBloody Mary.Been inside for years.Newgate, I think.And as for what she looked like,well, you should know - you met her.What?When me and Watts dida runner at HighgateWe thought she was done for but the sillytart couldn't run away in a dress, could she?No, the only person Imet was the vicar's wife,a Mrs Ellis.That was no vicar's wife mate.That was Bloody Mary.Just so I'm clear,crystal clear,you had the perpetratorin that very roomand you let her go.Sir, I can only apolo..This is verydisappointing laddie..Clearly I should have stuckwith first instinct. I willnot make that mistake again.Sorry..Another officer will takeover the investigation.Sir, that..What happened here?Went to see my sister.What, she did that?I gave as good as I got. ActuallyI think she came off worse.Now, I have some information.My sister did see the thief. It wasa woman, fair hair, black dress.Old, very old, at least 50.Did she recognise her?Not a clue. Unlike theconstable from Scotland Yardwho drinks at my local.How he loves the chatwhen he's had a few.Reckon I'd make a goodlady detective myself.Tell me everything you know.I was just coming to get you.She's a wily one,that Clementine.Remind me to employher more often.Where are you going?To solve the case.But you have not beenworking the case.I have and I have news.You're in the clear.Come on Moses.We've work to do.So.What did the vicar say?What I expected.He has no wife.Where's the informationI requested?Since you are officiallyoff the investigation,I thought it saferto memorise itjust in case I was stoppedcoming out of the yard.Don't get carried away, man.But you are off the case, Sir?I don't wish to talk about it.It's all anyone can talk about.Good for them.If you would kindlyimpart the informationthat has been so carefullyconcealed in that brain of yoursand hurry up about it.This bloody Mary's realname is Mary Dawson.She was part of a gang of diamondsmugglers back in the 50s.She served 25 years at Newgate,was released last week.What is it, Sir?Who sends flowersto a pauper grave?Yes, that particular grave receivesflowers each and every month.Write down the addressof the sender for me.Certainly, Inspector.What?Sorry Sir.Have you ever beentaken off a case before?I thought I made it clear thatI do not wish to talk about it.You did Sir. Sorry,Sir. Understood.For what it's worth, Sir, theofficer Munro replaced you with is..Sorry Sir, you do notwish to talk about it.Thank you detective.Who is it?Carmichael, Sir.Carmichael? Couldn't investigatea booze up in a brewery, that one.As requested, Sir.Address of the account holder.Thank you.It's a curious thing, but you're notthe first person who has inquiredabout that particularaccount today.Who else has inquired about it?A lady. Blond hairdetermined demeanour.I don't know where to begin.I can explain.Don't bother.See to it that Miss Scarletstays in the carriage.Yes, Sir.Hello Miss Scarlet.Do not converse with her orlet her out of your sight.I'll deal with you later.InspectorI thought you'd been replacedon the investigation.And I thought sending flowers toa grave listed in the stolen filesmight have been somethingthat you would have mentioned.No, it's merely a coincidencethat my connectionwith that graveshould have dovetailedwith this investigation.I've been in the force along time, Mr. Thackeryand in my experience,a coincidence never holdsup to much scrutiny.Well, in thiscase, you're wrong.It is a simple explanation,However it's not somethingI'm comfortable to speak of,nor should I have toexplain myself to you.Well, if you prefer, you can explainyourself to Detective Carmichael,who I believeSuperintendent Munrohas now assigned to this case.And I can assure you he willnot be as discrete as I am.The fact is.I had a humble upbringing.It was more than humble.I was born in the workhouse.It's something I don'tlike to talk about.And rarely reveal, particularlybeing a man of such status,but from a young age I was.Utterly determined tomake something of myself,and as you can see.I was successful.There were many people whohelped me along the way.Not least of all, my wife.And for that I'mforever grateful.So in short,my fate could have beensomewhat different.And as a Christian man, and inmy position as chief coronerwhenever I happen upon a paupergrave, I like to send flowers.It is a small kindnessand it helps me remember.Remember?There, but for the grace of God,Go I.So.Well, I appreciateyour candor, Sir,but I'm afraid there's still some questionsthat I need to ask regarding the case.What, why?Surely we're done here?We're done whenI say we're done.Mr Thackery.How did you know I was here?Inspector Wellington specifically orderedme not to converse with you, Miss Scarlet.Very well.Although I'm surprised that agentleman with impeccable manners,such as yourself,would be so rude,I'm only following orders.Please forgive me, I do holdyou in the highest regard.I don't wish to get youinto trouble Detective.By answering one simple question,can you really do any harm?The florist advised that you'd been askingwho sent the flowers to the pauper grave?But I didn't speakto the florist.Moses got thatinformation to me.Well then, who was the blondlady the florist spoke of?No, I do not know thisMary Dawson or Bloody Mary,or whatever thedevil she's called.I'm as anxious as you to getthis criminal into custodyand find out whatthe hell is going on.And I've answered allyour questions inspector.My wife and the maid will beback from my errands soon.I'd like you gonebefore they return.You seem extremely keen toget rid of me, Mr. Thackery.Well, a reputation can beundone by such a visit.I do not want to be thetopic of idle gossip.I thought you were alone.No, that'll just be the maid.The maid who's runningerrands with your wife?No, do not openthat door. Please!Nice to see youagain, Inspector.Put the revolver down Mary.I was about to saythe same to you.And if you don't,I will shoot MrsThackery in the head.No, Mary, please,please do not do this.Shut up.I'll deal with you later.I saidput it down.Kick it towards me.Good.But on second thoughts, I thinkI'm gonna kill her anyway.I would recommendthat you do not.You know that using apoliceman's weapon is an offence.Would you have preferred if Ihad dispatched Detective Fitzroy?My real name is Alfie Frampton.Mary Dawson was my fiance.We were small time crooksbut we managed to pulloff a diamond heist.When can I see my wife?She knows nothingof any of this.Get on with it.I took the diamonds and ran.But Mary tracked me down.She's like a..Like a mad woman.She was attackingme. She was..Desperate to get hold of them.So I swallowed them.You swallowed the diamonds?And in return she gave me this.The police turned up aftera tip-off and arrested Mary.But I managed to escape.And with her inside.I saw a way out.To leave her behind.To leave my past behind.So I faked my own death.You used the corpse from thepauper's grave in Highgate.That's why you sentflowers to it each month.Poor soul..Whoever he wasgave me a new life.Frampton took the bodyto one of their hideouts,changed clothes with the man,and then gave him acut down his cheek,just like Dawsonhad done to him.I'm pretty sure he always told you thathe got that scar from the Crimea, Sir.I'm not the only onewho believed him.He told everyone that.I wasn't questioningyour judgment, Sir.From her prison cell,Mary Dawson read about the bodyin the papers and assumedit was that of her fianc.And then when she'dserved her time,she went about trackingdown his grave.Come.Detective Phelpscome and take a seat.Continue.Dawson believed that shewould find the diamondsthat Frampton had swallowedin one of those graves.But what she didn't know was thathe'd sold them to reinvent himself.He put himself throughmedical school,he changed his whole life.Whiskey, detective Phelps.Thank you Sir.What of your friend,Miss Scarlet?Thackery wanted to pin this onher at the earliest opportunityin the hope that the trailwould end there and then.If Dawson did find him, thenhe would cut a deal with him.Well, I think I'm fully briefed.That will be all,Inspector Wellington.Sir, I know that I disobeyedorders by continuing with the case.That will be all Inspector.Yes, Sir.Well, detective Phelps.I've heard nothing butgood reports about you.Tell me more about yourself.We're always on the lookout for a good loyal man.Yes, Sir.Thank you, Sir.How childish men are.Still, he'll get over it.No, he won't.Loyalty is everythingto men like Munro,and I disobeyed an order.Oh, so this is my fault?Actually, yes.I was the one who savedMrs Thackey's lifeand most probably yours, too.So I hear you and Mosesmade quite the partnership.First of many.I'm just teasing you, William.But I don't - you know- I don't like him.Now, I should get back to work.It's probably a good idea,trying to get back into thesuperintendent's good books.Eliza, will you at least pretendthat you say that for my sake,rather than your own benefit?William, you really do have alow opinion of me sometimes.Only sometimes?So any plans for this evening?Well, I did havetill Ivy buggered them up.Oh yes, Betsy wasn't it?Sorry about that.Miss Scarlet.Inspector Wellington.I'll leave you to it.Mr Potts, before you sayanything, please let me apologise.I'm not here to seeyou Miss Scarlet.Mr Potts, youreceived my messageand I would be delighted totake you up on your offerof that homemade steamedpudding, Miss Woods.Prince Albert's favorite,and I've addedsome extra raisins.Come on in.You can go on another adventurewith Eliza in a Victorian London.Miss Scarlet and the Duke continues new andexclusive to alibi on Tuesday night at 9:00.Next..Frankie Drake mysteries.OhAdvertise your product or brand herecontacttoday\n"

We brought this on  Resisting  Dead or alive  We're missing  Don't ask why  I close my eyes  Something inside  Existing  Better than God  Just listen  Take my time Anything you can do tospeed things upwould be really appreciated.I'm sorry,but we're doing everythingwe can.I'm sorry.- Which one?- Uh, the first one.Three, two, one.There we go.Go on, then.Don't touch the hot bit.There's a ligature markaround her neck.And this indentation......looks like a belt buckleto me.There's something embedded atthe site of the ligature mark.What is it?Paint?Metal perhaps.We'll know more after analysis.Right. Let's open her up.They're always doing that,right?Actually, no.Um, Maria wasn't answeringthe phone.I was worried.Doctor gave her a sedative.Want a cup of tea?Where do you think we gowhen we die?I don't think we go anywhere,Tom.I think this is it,and we have to make the mostof what we have.I think that's the point.When Maria's mom died......she just powered on through.I think that made it worse.I'll look after her.The police have asked usto do a formal identificationtomorrow.Do you want to come with us?I think I've seen enough.Death by strangulationconfirmedby the fractured Hyoid bone.The perpetrator used a belt,although there's alsoblunt force traumato the back of the head.She was deadprior to entering the water.And no sign of sexual assault.Uh, toxicology resultsare on the system.Um...Let's see.Decent amount of alcohol.Eighty milligrams.And GHB.Recreational or was she drugged?She might have taken itwillingly...- I didn't.- ...but nine times out of ten,in a scenario like this,the victim had the substanceadministeredwithout their knowledge.That's your lot.We'll tidy her upand she'll be ready foridentification in the morning.Get some sleep.You too. And, uh,thanks for the, um...- You okay?- Yeah. Just, um, just tired.Yeah.- Night.- Night, Tom.Where have you been?Come here.Did you find out anythingmore about what happened to you?And did you take GHB last night?No.That's what I'm saying.Someone drugged me,and then strangled mewith a belt.I wouldn't have taken GHBout of choice.And I'd only take a drinkfrom someone I trusted.Dad, this was someone I know.How are you?What you drinking?Beer. I don't know.It was given to me.Down. Down.- I'll make that.- It's okay. Do you want one?Sure.I'll get it.Maria, is this your daughter,Neve Kelly?Yeah, it's Neve.Can I...Can I touch her?Goodbye, sweetheart.They loved you so much,you idiot.I need your computer.What for?Um, I... I was just tryingto understand.We need to find photosfrom the party.See who else was there,who I might have beenhanging out with.- Did you see your mom?- Yeah.How is she?How do you think?Having you to myself, it...it's not fair.That website, it talks aboutthis multiverse theory,like maybe when you die,you live on in other realities.Like running parallel.You think that's what happenedto you?I don't know.Cheer up.Forget the rest.Drink.Write down names.Anyone you can rememberfrom the party.- Why, where are you going?- Club.Neve haring downthe back straightchasing the leader.Oh, they fell together.Both riders go down.Neve!Neve!Neve!I'm okay.I'm okay.Yeah, but Nicky,I keep telling you.What am I meant to do with that?Sparkle.Go on then.Didn't thinkyou'd be in today.I want to keep busy.So how are you?Good.No, like how are you?I saw this, um,this documentary,and the thing is,you should always ask twice.First time's just small talk.Second time's the important one.You know, the honest one.So how are you?I can't stop thinking about her.Boys.Police are taking statementsdown at the station.You should both goget it over with.I'll go after practice.You don't need to practicetoday, Joseph.I need to keep busy.Did you two see or hear anythingat the partythat might help the police?- I don't know.- Well, think.Don't you want to catchwhoever did this to Neve?Course I do.Uh, he was out of it.We both were.When did you see her last?I don't know about times.We talked, then she went off,went to get some food maybe?That's all I remember.I drank too much.I guess I walked homeand went to sleep.And you?Uh, same.Except I crashed in Raff's tent, so...If I could go backand change things, I would.- I'd be there for her.- We're all feeling that, Joseph.You're not alone, okay?Remember that.Neve was one of us.And we loved her.Get the statements done today,all right?So we're sticking to that story?Yeah.Who the fuck did it?I already gave a statement.Told them everything I knowwhich is pretty much jack shit.I still don't believe it.Why would someone do somethinglike that?You never knowwho you live next door to, mate.They could come for you next.Piss off.Hey, turn that up.We can confirmthat Neve was killedin the very early hoursof Sunday morningand are appealing for witnessesto come forward.We're asking that anyonewho attended the partymake contact as soon as possibleso that we can rule them outof our inquiries.I just want to knowwho did this to my daughter.Neve was a talentedmotocross riderand a promising artist.And a wonderful person,with so many reasons to live.So many people who loved her.If you can help,if you have any information,then please,please, contact the police.Please.I'm begging you.Who do you reckon did it?I don't remember seeing youafter that hot dog incident.We should get downto the station.- Yeah.- I was with Amber.- Do you wanna go together?- In your fucking dreams- you were.- No. Thanks.My dad won't let my sistergo out on her own anymore.- They might be in this room.- Ain't gonna be nobody we know.Get away from me.Just back off.Neve.Back off!I was about to comelooking for you.I was worried.That's a first.You look terrible.Cheers.Did you find anything out?Nicky's hiding somethingand Joseph's covering for him.Maybe the whole club's in on it.But you're mates.Something happened.It was like...everyone vanished,and I was alone.It felt likeI was gonna be alone forever.Neve, you've been traumatized.You might never rememberwhat happened.You should just let the policeget on with itbecause this is not goodfor you.Since when were you an experton what's good for me?Did you make that list of peoplewho were at the party?Yeah. It's over there.Neve,I... This is not okay,what you're doing.I... Investigatingyour own murder,I mean, that's a mind-fuck.I'm here for a reason, Dad.Unless you can thinkof a better one.I won't be somebody's victim.Yeah, but it's not right.Like, it'll drive you crazy.I want justice.And I have to understandwhat happenedbecause if I don't,I will go crazy.I think that's her.We were talking. It's oneof the last things I remember.She might've seen me with Nicky,might have some ideawhat happened.Alex Wyatt.God, is that her?I taught herwhen she was younger.No, don't touch the hot bit.Right.Ah, I remember now.You new here?Not exactly.- Environmentalist.- Yeah.How's that going?I work at the petrol station,so not great.Right.I'll make sure it's her,then you go question her.Neve, I'm not a police officer.This is...I need your fucking support,Dad.Just once.Um, hello?You kind of look likeyou want something.Are you talking to me?Can't see anyone else here.I was kind of hopingI'd see you again.Surprise.I waited around, you know.The other night.Like a sad twat.Were we talking long?It's nice to know I'm memorable.No. I, I...I just, I can't, um,can't remember much.Yeah, we talked.And we danced.And we drank.And then, you bailed.Are you okay?Don't ask me that.No, I am though.Yeah, I'm fine.Did you see who else I was with?Um, yeah. You were talkingto one of the Motocross guys.Tall, dark hair.- Nicky.- Mm-hmm.And then, Joe came overand you went off together.Just the two of you.That was the last time I saw you.Did you see where we went?Into the woods.I was kind of surprised.He didn't seem like your type.I gotta go.But it's dangerous round here.You shouldn't be on your own.I'll be fine.Sun's coming up.And I've got a staple gunin there, so...Let's go.Do you want me to goand talk to her?It doesn't matter.But isn't thatthe whole reason...She can see me, Dad.- How is that even possible?- I don't know.She doesn't even know you.Well...Maybe your mom can see you now.If, if other people can see you,then it makes sense.None of this makes sense, Dad.I don't know.Just leave it.Maybe you won't needto rely on me anymore.Maybe.Dan messaged.Wants me to go round.They're talking about a vigil.They're including mein decisions.It's nice.Yeah. You should go.Just drop me at the party field.Why?There's thingsI need to remember.I'll meet you back at the house.Be careful.What's the worstthat could happen?You okay?Yeah, why?I don't know, it's like you'vebeen avoiding me or something.- If it's about the race...- It's not.Hey!Hey!Hey!Did I get the silent treatment?Neve, how am I meant to knowwhat to say to youwhen you won't fuckingtalk to me?What do you want from me?From this?I just want you.What, like, forever?Yeah.What's wrong with that?It's ridiculous.This isn't living,this staying in Abbington,with the same peoplein the same place.We'll take a trip.We'll go traveling at the endof next season.Fuck.Are you even listening to me?There's nothing here for me.I'm here.Are you dumping me?I'm in love with you.You're not thinking straight.You had an accidentand you freaked out- and now you're talking shit.- I don't want this anymore.You think you're better than me.You think I'm beneath you.No one could everbe good enough for you.You're a fucking head case.All right, Joseph.You don't getto walk away from me. Hey!Don't think this is over!Do you hear me?These are amazing.I thought we could carry them.Then, it'd be likeshe's with us.Mm. That's a great idea.Can you print some more?We'll hand them out.Can I help?No, it's okay.Don't you want to talk aboutthe vigil?A vigil's not gonnabring her back, is it?I don't even knowwhere the idea came from,suddenly it's happening,suddenly everyone elsein this towngets to decide what we doabout my daughter.You know, people loved her.I don't care about other peopleright now.What they think, what they need,I couldn't give a shit.All I care about is Neve.All I want to knowis why she's lyingin some cold fucking morguewhen she should be upstairsin bed.It's fine. Uh, uh, I'm fine.What?What if, what if I told youthat Neve's still here?I know it sounds crazy,but she's not gone.I, I can see her, plain as day.I... She's, she's beenat my place.- She's been here in this house.- Why are you saying this?Because maybe you can see her,too, if you just try.I... You can come backto mine...- Oh, oh, you've been drinking.- No, no, no, no, no. I haven't.I swear, like,this is, this is the truth.I've stood overour dead daughter's body.- I know.- Then what the fuck- are you talking about?- Maria,- just let me explain to you...- No, you listen to me.- What's happened?- Oh, apparently Neve's not dead.No, that's not what I said.- Just get him out of my house.- No, Dan.- Dan. Please. Look.- No.I'm not crazy.Maria, just let me finish...What the hell are you thinking?- I'm not making it up.

      "Previously on Reign:You killed someone in the woodswhen the pagans forcedyou to choose a sacrifice.I murdered a man who wasabout to kill another.And to this day I wonder:did he have a family?I have very powerful uncles.What, the Duke of Guise?Do you have any ideawhat you've done?You just let the devil into our home.It's Father.He's gone utterly mad.You think I'm delusional?French forces marchedfor Calais this morning.I need the Duke's armyto save France.We stay and finish thisor we die trying.Fire!Support us and become VIP member to remove all ads from Did you see Francis yet?Not yet.It's strange how,after months of waiting,these last momentsare the most agonizing.What about you?Don't you want to look for Leith?He was conscriptedso he wouldn't be punished here.If he survived,he would never return.It's better that he doesn't.Why isn't Bash hereto greet his brother?He's out in the Blood Wood again,hunting for the Darkness.Why Bash feels it's his dutyto end this, I don't know.I just want him to come home to me.Take me away from courtand our mad king.God save Prince Francis!200 years!For 200 years the English haveoccupied our port city of Calais,but no longer!Calais is ours once again!And I am proud to saythat I fought alongsidethe bravest soldiers in Europe.And the Duke of Guise, whose men andbravery helped us achieve victory!Mention your father, Francis. Don'tlet that son of a bitch do it first.In truth, the real hero of Calaisis the man with the vision...of a France free and whole!The man who mastermindedthis victory!King Henry Valois!We have our work cut out for uswith that one. Get to it.Mary.Francis, you came back to me.You came back.God is on our side.Not only did we reclaim Calais,but I have news of my own:my spies in Englandhave been trackingthe queen's slow crawl to the grave.After countless rumorsand endless waiting, she is dead!The queen of England,Mary Tudor, is dead!The Tudor queen betrayedthe Catholic Church,her own faith, by naminga Protestant to the throne.But... God's will reigns.We will take the timeto relish our victories,knowing that one dayEngland will be ours,crushed and then rebornunder its rightful queen,Mary Stuart!I thought you might never forgive me,for going to Calaisinstead of Scotland.- Your mother...- Escaped...To Dunbar Castle. She's safe.I thought about you every night.I thought I'd neverget to tell you again...I love you.I overheard the servants complainingwhen I brought in the logs.I don't think they'vecome across many noblemenwho enjoy cutting their own firewood.I find it charming.And this home, our home,do you find it charming as well?It's lovely. I'm thrilled it wasavailable on such short notice.But I would ultimately liketo find something further from court.You said you would as well.Not Hungary; I know you've tiredof the weather in your homeland.I crave a warmer climate.But... but you,why are you so eager to putdistance between you and court?Is there someone thereyou hope to avoid?Lola, you can tell me the truth.Are you worried about a resemblance?Your hair is so dark and lovely.So is yours.The child will likely befairer than either of us.Well, many dark-haired peoplehave fair-haired children.No one will knowthe child isn't mine.Because I will be the happiestand proudest fatherand husband anyone has ever seen.- Mary...- Not yet.If we could lie here a little longer...Just a few more moments,with nothing else to think aboutexcept each other.I know you have grave reservations.But today you are faced withthe news that Mary Tudor has died.The world will be lookingto you for your response.And if I shall stakemy claim to England.Elizabeth will be looking.She knows that she's mostvulnerable to your claim now,before her coronation,before she consolidates her power.It's a brief window of opportunitythat my fatherseems keen to take advantage of.If I stake my claim,there will be war.I will be declaring myselfmy cousin's enemy for life.I just want it all to go away.I don't want to think about England,or my cousin, or my half brotherand his lordswho now control Scotland.I just got you back.I want us to havea chance to love each other.You told me once that youwould support whatever decisionI made in regards to England.Is that still true?I will stand by you. You can counton me, as I count on you.I'm thinking of writingmy cousin a letter.Did you find anything?More sacrifices, 50 paces back.They've been dead for a few days.My lord, it grows darker.It's an eclipse. Don't be afraid.It's blood.Fresh blood.Another sacrifice to the Darkness?Don't touch him.That boy came out of the shadows.He's cold as ice.It's all right! It's all right!I'm not going to hurt you!It's all right!You're safe now. My name is Sebastianand I want to help you.What's your name?This whistle, I know what it means,and it strikes fear in my heart, too.Now, where did you get it?Have you seen him?Have you seen the Darkness?Don't bring him backwith us, my lord.That child will take us all to hell.No, he won't.He'll take us to the Darkness.Welcome.I got your message. You saidyou wanted to discuss business?Gabrielle, if you don't mind.- Shall I return later?- Not tonight, beauty.You on the other hand...Why don't you come back herewhen you finish your chores?An interesting choice,assuming you let her knowshe has one, since she's a servantand you're a duke.I will let her know.I liked her.And she's certainly a step upfrom one of Catherine's spies.I wanted to discuss this letteryou wrote to Elizabeth of England.At least three peopleread every letter you send,even the ones deliveredthrough private messengers.You think I don't know that?And why do you question my word?Your letter statesthat you want peacewith your cousin and her country,and for thatyou're willing to relinquishyour claim on England forever.A thought suited for another world.But we live in this one.If I stake my claim,thousands of people will dieto try and make it good.Either Elizabeth or Iwill lose our heads. And for what?I'm already Queen of Scotland.I'm going to be Queen of France.Isn't that enough?So you're willing to disarm,hoping your opponent will disarm?Here's what you should know: when youdisarm, your opponent shoots you.We're not at war.Royals are always at war.Why? Why must I join in this madness?I can be a good wife to Francisand a good queen to his country.You can never have a normal lifebecause of who you are. And withoutpower you're nothing but a threat.Mary, the truth is, you're stillsimply a guest at French court,the wife of the Dauphin.You must beg the king and queenfor anything Scotland may need.All your power comes from whatyou might do in the future.This is your only card.Once you play it...It's gone.Bash, there you are. Why are you...?Who's this?I found him in the woods,alone and covered in blood.He won't say a wordabout what happened to him.The blood isn't his.He has no cuts, no bite marks,nothing to match the othervictims of the Darkness.What makes you thinkthe child encountered him?He was carrying this.It's a kind of pagan whistle.I've heard it twice before, and bothtimes the Darkness was nearby.I think he uses itas a warning to inspire fear.Well, if it belongs to the Darkness,how did this child get a hold of it?- You must have got close to him.- Was your family chosen?- Were they sacrificed?- Can you tell us where you were?Enough!Leave the boy alone.He's been through hell.You don't needto hold him over the coals.Are you hurt?No one will hurt you here. I promise.The child knows something.He's just too frightened to speak.To you, he's afraid of you.Perhaps the situation requiresa more delicate approach.From the duke I learned nothing.Well, nothing of political interest.But this morning I bedone of his lieutenants,who was curious to see whatattractions I held for his master.Men. It always works.And was he more forthcoming?Much.He says King Henry refuses to delaywhile supplies and armiesare being replenished.He will not wait on England.They've just returned from war.Henry said they'd taketime to celebrate Calais.Mobilization has already begun. Theofficers are being sworn to secrecy.The king means to attackEngland within the week.He wants to slay Elizabethand put Mary on the throne then.Good afternoon.I'm looking for Lord Julien.Will you tell him his Uncle Bartosis here to see him?Yes, sir.Oh, Bartos! How good to see you.You look positively road-weary.Please, come in. Thank you.Leave us. We're fine here.- Would the gentlemen...?- We're fine.What's all the fuss?And when did we get so familiar?I'm not here to bereunited with a secretary.I want to talk to my nephew directly.Remy...where is he?Where is Lord Julien?- Lord Julien's away.- Where?He's been out of touchwith the family for monthsgallivanting all overthe continent for nearly a year.The family sent me here to find him,after we heard a rumorhe'd been married at French court.It's true, he's bothmarried and with child.He's hard to keep in check, butI'll start at the tavern he favors.Where are you staying?I'll come around with Julienas soon as I track him down.He's evading his family,I don't know why,but those who finance his disregarddeserve an explanation.I'll wait right here for his return.I have to tell you something,I have to do it quicklyand you have to hear everything I saybeyond something that'll shock you.I don't understand.I love you, that is who I am,the man who loves you,but I'm not Lord Julien.What are you talking about?My real name is Remy.I was Lord Julien's personalsecretary before he died.This is madness.The real Julien Vargadied in a terrible fire.We were traveling through Bavaria.The inn we stopped atburned to the ground. I was carryingJulien's cloak, with its crest.The local magistrateassumed I was he.His life was there for the taking.So I took it.I took it and then I met youand I gave you a life.I gave us a life, a wonderful life.For his money, is that it?You robbed a dead man?Yes. It was a decisionmade in the moment,because I saw suddenlyhow easy it could be.He has a family far away,whom he hatedand rarely saw,money he could never use.So I let the stipends keep comingbut, eventually,they wanted contact with theirwandering son, wanted to see him.And then you met me. Good timing, wasit, because the stipends got cut off?- Do I have that right?- Yes.You were going to fleece mefor all you couldand then run from your crime.The story you told about beingdisenfranchised from your family,it all makes sense,they weren't your family at all.Did you murder him?No. No, I did not.You might think I'mthe lowest form of grave robber,but I didn't kill him.And while I plannedto leave you, I didn't.I stayed,because I fell in love with you.I risked everything to be with you.I risked this day,which I prayed would never come.Have you been caught? Is that whyyou're telling me this now?There is a man in the other room.He is Lord Julien's uncle,sent by the family to find him.You can hate mefor the rest of your life.You can turn me into the authorities.All I ask is that you back me upfor as long as it takesto get him out of this houseand out of our lives.I don't know who you are.But I'm not sure I want him to leave,because you terrify me.You're sure?He could just be mobilizing againsta counterattack on Calais.A naval commander's confirmed it.Henry has ordered a fleet to set sailfor England by week's end.You've seen the state ofthe French army. If Henry invades...We will be slaughtered.After Calais,we are depleted on all fronts.There must be some way to reach him.Francis...Henry doesn't understandright from wrong, or care.He's killed innocents,he's shut out his closest advisors,he's closed his mind to reason.No one can get through to him.This has gone on long enough.He has to be stopped.No. Absolutely not.Don't get sentimental about a fatherwho was never sentimental about you.But he is my father,and the king of France.We owe him our allegiance.Or how can we expect it ourselves?He is sick. He needs our help, notto be put down like some rabid dog.I need to get him away from here,away from the castle,take him somewhere.A hunting trip.A hunting trip? That's your solution?We have said before that he maybe being poisoned here in the castleby a means we havenot yet discovered.We have ruled out poison.I am not convinced.I know what he has doneand what he has become...But I need one last chanceto break through to him.I need to make surethat I have tried everything.All right.But whatever you plan on doing, do itquickly. We are running out of time.I will reach him.You know as well as I dothere's no reaching Henry. He's gone.- We promised Francis time.- The time is now.Catherine, I can't.I'd be defying my husband,betraying him, murdering his father.My husband,the father of my children,handing over my crown to youthe moment Francis is king.I can't think about myself.We need to think like queens now.Or thousands of menwill die needlesslyin a war we are not preparedfor and we cannot win.We cannot save Henry,but we can still save those men.And we can spare Francisfrom having to be a partof his father's murder.There is some truth in that.- And a strange kind of mercy.- So it's settled, then.Together, you and I are goingto kill the king of France.I realize we've talked aroundyour nephew's absence today.Yes, you've introducedme to his very silent new wife.Forgive my directness,but I'd appreciate some of the same.- Where are the servants?- I sent them home,as the truth is a delicate matter.Lord Julien's been gonefor some time.It was an issue of money.He had, gambling debts.I knew he enjoyed cards.It was rather a passion for him.One that sadly took precedenceover the passion he had for his wife.He was deeply in debtand fled from those debts.My nephew abandoned you?I can assure you,the love he bore his wife is true,and that this is excruciatingfor Lady Lola to discuss.Is that so?How can anyone be sureof someone who lies so easily,who uses others for what they canoffer him, regardless of the cost?- Lola...- The cost is to me,to my reputation,to my faith in another,in my husband,a man I gave my heart to.I assure you,I can speak to his heart,torn apart dailyas his feelings for you grew.And I can speak for the family.I had no idea about the depthof my nephew's gambling problems.To see you left in this way.I feel shame for my nephew.I assure you, the family willtake care of you financially.And the child.You make a passionate case.If only Julienhad your depth of feeling.If that's all thereis to be said for now?Yes. For now.I must return homeand alert the rest of the family.Remy, if you see Julien...Oh, of course.Wait. Is that Julien's ring?What?That's Julien's signet ring.Why are you wearing my nephew's ring?You see? You're notso scary under all that blood.We really shouldget you a proper bathand some lovely coversto sleep under.You know, when I was a little girl,my mother hada blanket made of fleece.How do you stay warm? Do your parentslet you sleep beside them?Where are you parents?They must be worriedthat you're cold or hurt.They're dead.I'm sorry.But you needn't fearthat they're worrying.I'm sure they're looking at you rightnow. And can see that you're safe.Can you tell mewhat happened to them?Then will you tell mewhat happened to you?So we can make sure itnever happens to anyone else.Visegard.What?What's Visegard?A bad place in the mountains.He took me there.Who did?The man with the sharp teeth.He's on a hunt. He could havean accident on his way back.What, a stray arrow?No, it's too dangerouswith Francis at his side.What about poison? Could you getsomething past his tasters?I tried that recently.It backfired.I can't see a way.I've never known youto wilt from a challenge.Certainly not when you weretrying to get rid of me.You're a very imaginative murderer.There must be a way.There is one time to get to him.Communion.He's been taking mass alone.There are no tasters, no guards.And he feels absolutely safe.These are for a private mass.Just him, a priestand the Almighty God.We will have one chance at this.We won't get another.And if we succeed, I'll be a widow.And Francis will rule.Long live the king.I've never heardof any town called Visegard.What do you hope to find there?The boy was neithersacrificed nor fed upon.Yet the Darkness broughthim there for some reason.If we find this place,it may hold clues.It may even be a placethe Darkness resides.And what makes you think that?When pagans spill bloodto feed the Darkness,- they have to bring it somewhere.- You don't know where this town is.It could be days away.You said that when you return,that you would take meto our new home, that you wouldget me away from Henry.- Perhaps I should leave you.- No, we have business still.You're right.Pack your things.We'll leave tonight.- I'll think of some excuse.- You're not planning to go with her?I can't involve her in this.If I tell her what I know,I have to tell her how I know it.How you know what exactly?That Visegard is more than justa place. It's a pagan word.It means \"Where Darkness rises.\"And that I know thisbecause I was born a pagan.Is that why you've taken this on?Because you feel some blamefor the blood spilled by this faith?It's more than just that.I was forced to killtwo men in those woods,a zealot of the faithand an innocent.And ever since then, I have...A darkness in me that I despise.The Darkness touched us all.It tortured Olivia.If you're going to searchfor Visegard, I'm going with you.There is nothing quite likethe feast of a fresh kill.I feel cleaner,stronger, ready to take on England.But to stage an invasion now,before we have replenishedour forces,is it not better to wait?You know, Francis...We should have done thisa long time ago.All those hunting tripsI shared with your brother,I regret not havinghad these moments with you.Why do you push so hardto conquer England?Perhaps I am...More ambitious than most kings.It was my fatherwho taught me to push hard.Oh, he expecteda great deal from his sons.Did you know he wascaptured by the Spaniards?I was six or seven at the time.They imprisoned him in Madrid,under the cruelest conditions.One day, my brotherand I were taken to visit him.He saw our boat and he ran to us.I ran to him.He passed us byand jumped in the boat.We'd been tradedas hostages for his freedom.Why did he let that happen?He was the one who arranged it.Sons must sacrificefor their fathers.This is the lesson.I learned it with my brother,beaten and starved for three years.Father...When we returned...There was no loving embrace.He was a hard man to please.Like God.Father, it wasn't right.What he did to you, it wasn't right.I believe in a loving God.And I believe His workis done by people like you,and you have so much moreto do in Francebefore you turn to England.You have already achieved the glory.Now do the good.Yes, of course.There are thingsto do in France first.I tell you, he asked meto keep the ringso that he wouldn't gamble awaya family keepsake.- Bartos, what are you looking for?- Julien is a large man.I see no boots his size,no cloaks that would fit him.There's no traceof my nephew anywhere.You're making an ordealout of nothing.Begging your pardon,mistress, I left my gloves...Not now, Benjamin.As they're my only pair...- Please be on your way.- You there.You work for the masterof this house, do you not?- This is a private matter, just go...- Where is he? Where is Lord Julien?He's standing right there.But this man is...This man...And this woman?His wife, my lord, Lady Lola.Get out, Benjamin. Just go.You took my nephew's name.- What else did you take?- I never harmed him.- I promise you.- Remy, just tell him what happened.Is he still alive? Answer me.It was an accident, I swear.- You killed him.- No, no, no!Let go, let go!Stop it! Stop it, please!- I'll kill you...- Let go of him!My God.I killed him.I have to go now. I'm moving today.But I wanted you to know that theseladies are going to look after you.They're the kindestgovernesses in the castle.It's for the best.They're going to take much bettercare of you than I ever could.Um...My mother gave thisto me when I left Scotland.She said it wouldalways keep me safe.I wanted you to have it.Please don't leave me.They'll burn me.Go.Why would you say that?You worship the gods,not God, don't you?I don't care if you're a pagan.I'm never goingto let anybody hurt you.Would you like to comeand stay with me, just for a while?You know,I don't even know your name.Pascal.- Mary, I did it.- What?I convinced himto postpone the invasion.France is safe.He listened to me.His sanity started trickling back in,and for a moment I couldactually see my father again.I'm not saying that he's cured.That may take time.What is it? What's wrong?How much time?- How can you be sure?- I'm not.- Then you agree, we can't risk it.- Risk what?Letting him live?Mary... what have you done?It's not too late!He has agreed not to invade England!He saw reason! He's getting better!- Do you hear me?- Well, if there's hope, maybe.There is hope! I've seen it!You have to stop this right now!Amen.Who sent you?Who sent you?Who?Your Majesty, the Duke of Guise.My friend! You're the only oneI can trust. I must speak with you.Alone.I thought your planwas to poison him.It was. I stopped it.I got to the priest in time.I don't understand. If you didn'tsend the assassin, who did?I don't know.But I can't help but noticewho's benefited the most, who's comeout of this smelling like a rose.My uncle. How did he knowthe specifics of our plan,that we called it off?He has spies, surely.What if he's playing both sides?What if he warned the kingof an attempt on his life?If we succeedin spite of this, job done:Francis becomes kingand the duke benefitsfrom his promiseof a position at court.If we fail...Then the duke is the manwho warned the king.He still benefits becausehe gains my father's trust.The only complicationwas our calling off the attempt.The duke's already warned the king;he looks like a hysterical foolif nothing happens.So he makes something happen.Sometimes, to sell a pailof water, you start a fire.If this is true,then the king will listen to no one- but the duke from now on.- He was listening to me.Do you both realizehow much danger you're inbecause of what you've done?The good newsis we're both still alive,so Henry doesn't suspect us, yet.But his paranoia is awakened.We'll never get another chance.Henry's untouchable now.God help us all.I lie behind the star-bright skyI do not fear this life's good-byePascal's coming with usif that's all right with you.Of course. He'll be in good hands.As will you.These men will escort you homeand stand guard until I return.I knew this would happen.You're goingto find Visegard, aren't you?I lie behind the star-bright skyI do not fear this life's good-byeI'm going to go search the mountains.If I find the manwith the sharp teeth,I'll make sure he can neverhurt you again. I promise.Pascal, you go wait for mein the carriage, please.I actually believed you.I believed you when you said youwanted us to have a life together,but this is our future:you breaking your wordand abandoning me to an empty homeso you can run off and be the hero.- You think I want this?- I don't know what you want.Maybe you're just not suitedto domestic life.Maybe neither of us are.For all your confidence,I think you've seen yourselfas the plaything of others.I know you were handed to melike an object,a punch line for whatwe both thought was a cruel joke.But this marriage is no longersomething that happened to me.It's...You are what I want.I want to come back to you.I just have to finish this first.Then come back to me...Or I'll kill you myself.I have to turn myself in.No. They'll neverbelieve it was an accident.They'll think you murderedthe uncle and Lord Julien.- Oh, God, I can't think.- We could run.We can't run.You need to get away from me.I've brought you nothing but pain.That's not true. Let me help you.No, I can't, Lola.When Julien's uncle doesn't return,his family will send investigators.- Lola, stop!- I'll say Bartos never got here,that he must have learnedthat Julien had died.We have a body. There'll beno ongoing hunt for Lord Julien.He will die here tonight,and you can be free.No. You are good and honest.What have I done to you?You said the fire burnedhis body beyond recognition.If it worked before,it could work again.And you can vanishwithout anyone following.What about you?What have I left you with?Our memories before tonight.A name and respectabilityfor this child.And you, a widow.We can never see each other again.I know.Lola, I'm so sorry.So am I.We haven't much time.The servantscould return at any moment.Go back to French Court.Don't be alone. There are too manychallenges ahead of you.If the real father is a good man,let him be a part of your lives.Promise me that.Go now, my love.And don't look back.Promise me you'll run.I'll run for my life.I lie behind the star-bright skyI do not fear this life's good-byeClose your eyes for my caress.I've never heard that rhyme before.Who taught it to you?My father.Do you want to tell mewhat happened to your father?A bad man killed him.I think you're ignorant.I think the bloodlust is in you.Ah!Whoever killed him willsomeday be punished.Bad men always get what they deserve.Francis, Henry had to be stopped.It wasn't an easy decision to make,but I thought it was the only way.I know what you thought,but you agreed to wait.- You lied to me.- I'm sorry.Sorry for what?You don't regret it, we bothknow that you'd do it again.When you told me that you wantedto relinquish your claim to England,I stood by you, and todaywhen I told you what I wanted,I thought you stood by me as well.Instead, you worked with my motherto murder the king of France!We wanted to spare you.I didn't want you to carry thatburden for the rest of your life.I did what you couldn't do.I did it for France,for the nation that you usedto put before all else, even me.Because that is what rulers do!What is wrong with you?He is my father!There are risks that you takefor the people that you love.You used to know that.Who are you becoming?It was goodto be with Francis today.The boy truly loves me,I understand that now.I have misjudged himin so many ways.He doesn't want England.He shies from conquest.Without my constant pushing,he would be contentto hide under the covers with Mary.I can't live in fear...Or tolerate it in others.I was so close to deathtoday, I could feel...Its dark hand on my throat.But God...Spared me for the work I must do.It is for meto sit on England's throne,to slay their bastard queen,and rule a new empire!It's what I was meant for!But... Francis was right.Before... I invade England...There are thingsI must do here in France.First...I must kill my son...And wed his wife.Advertise your product or brand herecontact  today\n"

Don'tlet that son of a bitch do it first.In truth, the real hero of Calaisis the man with the vision...of a France free and whole!The man who mastermindedthis victory!King Henry Valois!We have our work cut out for uswith that one. Get to it.Mary.Francis, you came back to me.You came back.God is on our side.Not only did we reclaim Calais,but I have news of my own:my spies in Englandhave been trackingthe queen's slow crawl to the grave.After countless rumorsand endless waiting, she is dead!The queen of England,Mary Tudor, is dead!The Tudor queen betrayedthe Catholic Church,her own faith, by naminga Protestant to the throne.But... God's will reigns.We will take the timeto relish our victories,knowing that one dayEngland will be ours,crushed and then rebornunder its rightful queen,Mary Stuart!I thought you might never forgive me,for going to Calaisinstead of Scotland.- Your mother...- Escaped...To Dunbar Castle. She's safe.I thought about you every night.I thought I'd neverget to tell you again...I love you.I overheard the servants complainingwhen I brought in the logs.I don't think they'vecome across many noblemenwho enjoy cutting their own firewood.I find it charming.And this home, our home,do you find it charming as well?It's lovely. I'm thrilled it wasavailable on such short notice.But I would ultimately liketo find something further from court.You said you would as well.Not Hungary; I know you've tiredof the weather in your homeland.I crave a warmer climate.But... but you,why are you so eager to putdistance between you and court?Is there someone thereyou hope to avoid?Lola, you can tell me the truth.Are you worried about a resemblance?Your hair is so dark and lovely.So is yours.The child will likely befairer than either of us.Well, many dark-haired peoplehave fair-haired children.No one will knowthe child isn't mine.Because I will be the happiestand proudest fatherand husband anyone has ever seen.- Mary...- Not yet.If we could lie here a little longer...Just a few more moments,with nothing else to think aboutexcept each other.I know you have grave reservations.But today you are faced withthe news that Mary Tudor has died.The world will be lookingto you for your response.And if I shall stakemy claim to England.Elizabeth will be looking.She knows that she's mostvulnerable to your claim now,before her coronation,before she consolidates her power.It's a brief window of opportunitythat my fatherseems keen to take advantage of.If I stake my claim,there will be war.I will be declaring myselfmy cousin's enemy for life.I just want it all to go away.I don't want to think about England,or my cousin, or my half brotherand his lordswho now control Scotland.I just got you back.I want us to havea chance to love each other.You told me once that youwould support whatever decisionI made in regards to England.Is that still true?I will stand by you. You can counton me, as I count on you.I'm thinking of writingmy cousin a letter.Did you find anything?More sacrifices, 50 paces back.They've been dead for a few days.My lord, it grows darker.It's an eclipse. Don't be afraid.It's blood.Fresh blood.Another sacrifice to the Darkness?Don't touch him.That boy came out of the shadows.He's cold as ice.It's all right! It's all right!I'm not going to hurt you!It's all right!You're safe now. My name is Sebastianand I want to help you.What's your name?This whistle, I know what it means,and it strikes fear in my heart, too.Now, where did you get it?Have you seen him?Have you seen the Darkness?Don't bring him backwith us, my lord.That child will take us all to hell.No, he won't.He'll take us to the Darkness.Welcome.I got your message. You saidyou wanted to discuss business?Gabrielle, if you don't mind.- Shall I return later?- Not tonight, beauty.You on the other hand...Why don't you come back herewhen you finish your chores?An interesting choice,assuming you let her knowshe has one, since she's a servantand you're a duke.I will let her know.I liked her.And she's certainly a step upfrom one of Catherine's spies.I wanted to discuss this letteryou wrote to Elizabeth of England.At least three peopleread every letter you send,even the ones deliveredthrough private messengers.You think I don't know that?And why do you question my word?Your letter statesthat you want peacewith your cousin and her country,and for thatyou're willing to relinquishyour claim on England forever.A thought suited for another world.But we live in this one.If I stake my claim,thousands of people will dieto try and make it good.Either Elizabeth or Iwill lose our heads. And for what?I'm already Queen of Scotland.I'm going to be Queen of France.Isn't that enough?So you're willing to disarm,hoping your opponent will disarm?Here's what you should know: when youdisarm, your opponent shoots you.We're not at war.Royals are always at war.Why? Why must I join in this madness?I can be a good wife to Francisand a good queen to his country.You can never have a normal lifebecause of who you are. And withoutpower you're nothing but a threat.Mary, the truth is, you're stillsimply a guest at French court,the wife of the Dauphin.You must beg the king and queenfor anything Scotland may need.All your power comes from whatyou might do in the future.This is your only card.Once you play it...It's gone.Bash, there you are. Why are you...?Who's this?I found him in the woods,alone and covered in blood.He won't say a wordabout what happened to him.The blood isn't his.He has no cuts, no bite marks,nothing to match the othervictims of the Darkness.What makes you thinkthe child encountered him?He was carrying this.It's a kind of pagan whistle.I've heard it twice before, and bothtimes the Darkness was nearby.I think he uses itas a warning to inspire fear.Well, if it belongs to the Darkness,how did this child get a hold of it?- You must have got close to him.- Was your family chosen?- Were they sacrificed?- Can you tell us where you were?Enough!Leave the boy alone.He's been through hell.You don't needto hold him over the coals.Are you hurt?No one will hurt you here. I promise.The child knows something.He's just too frightened to speak.To you, he's afraid of you.Perhaps the situation requiresa more delicate approach.From the duke I learned nothing.Well, nothing of political interest.But this morning I bedone of his lieutenants,who was curious to see whatattractions I held for his master.Men. It always works.And was he more forthcoming?Much.He says King Henry refuses to delaywhile supplies and armiesare being replenished.He will not wait on England.They've just returned from war.Henry said they'd taketime to celebrate Calais.Mobilization has already begun. Theofficers are being sworn to secrecy.The king means to attackEngland within the week.He wants to slay Elizabethand put Mary on the throne then.Good afternoon.I'm looking for Lord Julien.Will you tell him his Uncle Bartosis here to see him?Yes, sir.Oh, Bartos! How good to see you.You look positively road-weary.Please, come in. Thank you.Leave us. We're fine here.- Would the gentlemen...?- We're fine.What's all the fuss?And when did we get so familiar?I'm not here to bereunited with a secretary.I want to talk to my nephew directly.Remy...where is he?Where is Lord Julien?- Lord Julien's away.- Where?He's been out of touchwith the family for monthsgallivanting all overthe continent for nearly a year.The family sent me here to find him,after we heard a rumorhe'd been married at French court.It's true, he's bothmarried and with child.He's hard to keep in check, butI'll start at the tavern he favors.Where are you staying?I'll come around with Julienas soon as I track him down.He's evading his family,I don't know why,but those who finance his disregarddeserve an explanation.I'll wait right here for his return.I have to tell you something,I have to do it quicklyand you have to hear everything I saybeyond something that'll shock you.I don't understand.I love you, that is who I am,the man who loves you,but I'm not Lord Julien.What are you talking about?My real name is Remy.I was Lord Julien's personalsecretary before he died.This is madness.The real Julien Vargadied in a terrible fire.We were traveling through Bavaria.The inn we stopped atburned to the ground. I was carryingJulien's cloak, with its crest.The local magistrateassumed I was he.His life was there for the taking.So I took it.I took it and then I met youand I gave you a life.I gave us a life, a wonderful life.For his money, is that it?You robbed a dead man?Yes. It was a decisionmade in the moment,because I saw suddenlyhow easy it could be.He has a family far away,whom he hatedand rarely saw,money he could never use.So I let the stipends keep comingbut, eventually,they wanted contact with theirwandering son, wanted to see him.And then you met me. Good timing, wasit, because the stipends got cut off?- Do I have that right?- Yes.You were going to fleece mefor all you couldand then run from your crime.The story you told about beingdisenfranchised from your family,it all makes sense,they weren't your family at all.Did you murder him?No. No, I did not.You might think I'mthe lowest form of grave robber,but I didn't kill him.And while I plannedto leave you, I didn't.I stayed,because I fell in love with you.I risked everything to be with you.I risked this day,which I prayed would never come.Have you been caught? Is that whyyou're telling me this now?There is a man in the other room.He is Lord Julien's uncle,sent by the family to find him.You can hate mefor the rest of your life.You can turn me into the authorities.All I ask is that you back me upfor as long as it takesto get him out of this houseand out of our lives.I don't know who you are.But I'm not sure I want him to leave,because you terrify me.You're sure?He could just be mobilizing againsta counterattack on Calais.A naval commander's confirmed it.Henry has ordered a fleet to set sailfor England by week's end.You've seen the state ofthe French army. If Henry invades...We will be slaughtered.After Calais,we are depleted on all fronts.There must be some way to reach him.Francis...Henry doesn't understandright from wrong, or care.He's killed innocents,he's shut out his closest advisors,he's closed his mind to reason.No one can get through to him.This has gone on long enough.He has to be stopped.No. Absolutely not.Don't get sentimental about a fatherwho was never sentimental about you.But he is my father,and the king of France.We owe him our allegiance.Or how can we expect it ourselves?He is sick. He needs our help, notto be put down like some rabid dog.I need to get him away from here,away from the castle,take him somewhere.A hunting trip.A hunting trip? That's your solution?We have said before that he maybe being poisoned here in the castleby a means we havenot yet discovered.We have ruled out poison.I am not convinced.I know what he has doneand what he has become...But I need one last chanceto break through to him.I need to make surethat I have tried everything.All right.But whatever you plan on doing, do itquickly. We are running out of time.I will reach him.You know as well as I dothere's no reaching Henry. He's gone.- We promised Francis time.- The time is now.Catherine, I can't.I'd be defying my husband,betraying him, murdering his father.My husband,the father of my children,handing over my crown to youthe moment Francis is king.I can't think about myself.We need to think like queens now.Or thousands of menwill die needlesslyin a war we are not preparedfor and we cannot win.We cannot save Henry,but we can still save those men.And we can spare Francisfrom having to be a partof his father's murder.There is some truth in that.- And a strange kind of mercy.- So it's settled, then.Together, you and I are goingto kill the king of France.I realize we've talked aroundyour nephew's absence today.Yes, you've introducedme to his very silent new wife.Forgive my directness,but I'd appreciate some of the same.- Where are the servants?- I sent them home,as the truth is a delicate matter.Lord Julien's been gonefor some time.It was an issue of money.He had, gambling debts.I knew he enjoyed cards.It was rather a passion for him.One that sadly took precedenceover the passion he had for his wife.He was deeply in debtand fled from those debts.My nephew abandoned you?I can assure you,the love he bore his wife is true,and that this is excruciatingfor Lady Lola to discuss.Is that so?How can anyone be sureof someone who lies so easily,who uses others for what they canoffer him, regardless of the cost?- Lola...- The cost is to me,to my reputation,to my faith in another,in my husband,a man I gave my heart to.I assure you,I can speak to his heart,torn apart dailyas his feelings for you grew.And I can speak for the family.I had no idea about the depthof my nephew's gambling problems.To see you left in this way.I feel shame for my nephew.I assure you, the family willtake care of you financially.And the child.You make a passionate case.If only Julienhad your depth of feeling.If that's all thereis to be said for now?Yes. For now.I must return homeand alert the rest of the family.Remy, if you see Julien...Oh, of course.Wait. Is that Julien's ring?What?That's Julien's signet ring.Why are you wearing my nephew's ring?You see? You're notso scary under all that blood.We really shouldget you a proper bathand some lovely coversto sleep under.You know, when I was a little girl,my mother hada blanket made of fleece.How do you stay warm? Do your parentslet you sleep beside them?Where are you parents?They must be worriedthat you're cold or hurt.They're dead.I'm sorry.But you needn't fearthat they're worrying.I'm sure they're looking at you rightnow. And can see that you're safe.Can you tell mewhat happened to them?Then will you tell mewhat happened to you?So we can make sure itnever happens to anyone else.Visegard.What?What's Visegard?A bad place in the mountains.He took me there.Who did?The man with the sharp teeth.He's on a hunt. He could havean accident on his way back.What, a stray arrow?No, it's too dangerouswith Francis at his side.What about poison? Could you getsomething past his tasters?I tried that recently.It backfired.I can't see a way.I've never known youto wilt from a challenge.Certainly not when you weretrying to get rid of me.You're a very imaginative murderer.There must be a way.There is one time to get to him.Communion.He's been taking mass alone.There are no tasters, no guards.And he feels absolutely safe.These are for a private mass.Just him, a priestand the Almighty God.We will have one chance at this.We won't get another.And if we succeed, I'll be a widow.And Francis will rule.Long live the king.I've never heardof any town called Visegard.What do you hope to find there?The boy was neithersacrificed nor fed upon.Yet the Darkness broughthim there for some reason.If we find this place,it may hold clues.It may even be a placethe Darkness resides.And what makes you think that?When pagans spill bloodto feed the Darkness,- they have to bring it somewhere.- You don't know where this town is.It could be days away.You said that when you return,that you would take meto our new home, that you wouldget me away from Henry.- Perhaps I should leave you.- No, we have business still.You're right.Pack your things.We'll leave tonight.- I'll think of some excuse.- You're not planning to go with her?I can't involve her in this.If I tell her what I know,I have to tell her how I know it.How you know what exactly?That Visegard is more than justa place. It's a pagan word.It means \"Where Darkness rises.\"And that I know thisbecause I was born a pagan.Is that why you've taken this on?Because you feel some blamefor the blood spilled by this faith?It's more than just that.I was forced to killtwo men in those woods,a zealot of the faithand an innocent.And ever since then, I have...A darkness in me that I despise.The Darkness touched us all.It tortured Olivia.If you're going to searchfor Visegard, I'm going with you.There is nothing quite likethe feast of a fresh kill.I feel cleaner,stronger, ready to take on England.But to stage an invasion now,before we have replenishedour forces,is it not better to wait?You know, Francis...We should have done thisa long time ago.All those hunting tripsI shared with your brother,I regret not havinghad these moments with you.Why do you push so hardto conquer England?Perhaps I am...More ambitious than most kings.It was my fatherwho taught me to push hard.Oh, he expecteda great deal from his sons.Did you know he wascaptured by the Spaniards?I was six or seven at the time.They imprisoned him in Madrid,under the cruelest conditions.One day, my brotherand I were taken to visit him.He saw our boat and he ran to us.I ran to him.He passed us byand jumped in the boat.We'd been tradedas hostages for his freedom.Why did he let that happen?He was the one who arranged it.Sons must sacrificefor their fathers.This is the lesson.I learned it with my brother,beaten and starved for three years.Father...When we returned...There was no loving embrace.He was a hard man to please.Like God.Father, it wasn't right.What he did to you, it wasn't right.I believe in a loving God.And I believe His workis done by people like you,and you have so much moreto do in Francebefore you turn to England.You have already achieved the glory.Now do the good.Yes, of course.There are thingsto do in France first.I tell you, he asked meto keep the ringso that he wouldn't gamble awaya family keepsake.- Bartos, what are you looking for?- Julien is a large man.I see no boots his size,no cloaks that would fit him.There's no traceof my nephew anywhere.You're making an ordealout of nothing.Begging your pardon,mistress, I left my gloves...Not now, Benjamin.As they're my only pair...- Please be on your way.- You there.You work for the masterof this house, do you not?- This is a private matter, just go...- Where is he? Where is Lord Julien?He's standing right there.But this man is...This man...And this woman?His wife, my lord, Lady Lola.Get out, Benjamin. Just go.You took my nephew's name.- What else did you take?- I never harmed him.- I promise you.- Remy, just tell him what happened.Is he still alive? Answer me.It was an accident, I swear.- You killed him.- No, no, no!Let go, let go!Stop it! Stop it, please!- I'll kill you...- Let go of him!My God.I killed him.I have to go now. I'm moving today.But I wanted you to know that theseladies are going to look after you.They're the kindestgovernesses in the castle.It's for the best.They're going to take much bettercare of you than I ever could.Um...My mother gave thisto me when I left Scotland.She said it wouldalways keep me safe.I wanted you to have it.Please don't leave me.They'll burn me.Go.Why would you say that?You worship the gods,not God, don't you?I don't care if you're a pagan.I'm never goingto let anybody hurt you.Would you like to comeand stay with me, just for a while?You know,I don't even know your name.Pascal.- Mary, I did it.- What?I convinced himto postpone the invasion.France is safe.He listened to me.His sanity started trickling back in,and for a moment I couldactually see my father again.I'm not saying that he's cured.That may take time.What is it? What's wrong?How much time?- How can you be sure?- I'm not.- Then you agree, we can't risk it.- Risk what?Letting him live?Mary... what have you done?It's not too late!He has agreed not to invade England!He saw reason! He's getting better!- Do you hear me?- Well, if there's hope, maybe.There is hope! I've seen it!You have to stop this right now!Amen.Who sent you?Who sent you?Who?Your Majesty, the Duke of Guise.My friend! You're the only oneI can trust. I must speak with you.Alone.I thought your planwas to poison him.It was. I stopped it.I got to the priest in time.I don't understand. If you didn'tsend the assassin, who did?I don't know.But I can't help but noticewho's benefited the most, who's comeout of this smelling like a rose.My uncle. How did he knowthe specifics of our plan,that we called it off?He has spies, surely.What if he's playing both sides?What if he warned the kingof an attempt on his life?If we succeedin spite of this, job done:Francis becomes kingand the duke benefitsfrom his promiseof a position at court.If we fail...Then the duke is the manwho warned the king.He still benefits becausehe gains my father's trust.The only complicationwas our calling off the attempt.The duke's already warned the king;he looks like a hysterical foolif nothing happens.So he makes something happen.Sometimes, to sell a pailof water, you start a fire.If this is true,then the king will listen to no one- but the duke from now on.- He was listening to me.Do you both realizehow much danger you're inbecause of what you've done?The good newsis we're both still alive,so Henry doesn't suspect us, yet.But his paranoia is awakened.We'll never get another chance.Henry's untouchable now.God help us all.I lie behind the star-bright skyI do not fear this life's good-byePascal's coming with usif that's all right with you.Of course. He'll be in good hands.As will you.These men will escort you homeand stand guard until I return.I knew this would happen.You're goingto find Visegard, aren't you?I lie behind the star-bright skyI do not fear this life's good-byeI'm going to go search the mountains.If I find the manwith the sharp teeth,I'll make sure he can neverhurt you again. I promise.Pascal, you go wait for mein the carriage, please.I actually believed you.I believed you when you said youwanted us to have a life together,but this is our future:you breaking your wordand abandoning me to an empty homeso you can run off and be the hero.- You think I want this?- I don't know what you want.Maybe you're just not suitedto domestic life.Maybe neither of us are.For all your confidence,I think you've seen yourselfas the plaything of others.I know you were handed to melike an object,a punch line for whatwe both thought was a cruel joke.But this marriage is no longersomething that happened to me.It's...You are what I want.I want to come back to you.I just have to finish this first.Then come back to me...Or I'll kill you myself.I have to turn myself in.No. They'll neverbelieve it was an accident.They'll think you murderedthe uncle and Lord Julien.- Oh, God, I can't think.- We could run.We can't run.You need to get away from me.I've brought you nothing but pain.That's not true. Let me help you.No, I can't, Lola.When Julien's uncle doesn't return,his family will send investigators.- Lola, stop!- I'll say Bartos never got here,that he must have learnedthat Julien had died.We have a body. There'll beno ongoing hunt for Lord Julien.He will die here tonight,and you can be free.No. You are good and honest.What have I done to you?You said the fire burnedhis body beyond recognition.If it worked before,it could work again.And you can vanishwithout anyone following.What about you?What have I left you with?Our memories before tonight.A name and respectabilityfor this child.And you, a widow.We can never see each other again.I know.Lola, I'm so sorry.So am I.We haven't much time.The servantscould return at any moment.Go back to French Court.Don't be alone. There are too manychallenges ahead of you.If the real father is a good man,let him be a part of your lives.Promise me that.Go now, my love.And don't look back.Promise me you'll run.I'll run for my life.I lie behind the star-bright skyI do not fear this life's good-byeClose your eyes for my caress.I've never heard that rhyme before.Who taught it to you?My father.Do you want to tell mewhat happened to your father?A bad man killed him.I think you're ignorant.I think the bloodlust is in you.Ah!Whoever killed him willsomeday be punished.Bad men always get what they deserve.Francis, Henry had to be stopped.It wasn't an easy decision to make,but I thought it was the only way.I know what you thought,but you agreed to wait.- You lied to me.- I'm sorry.Sorry for what?You don't regret it, we bothknow that you'd do it again.When you told me that you wantedto relinquish your claim to England,I stood by you, and todaywhen I told you what I wanted,I thought you stood by me as well.Instead, you worked with my motherto murder the king of France!We wanted to spare you.I didn't want you to carry thatburden for the rest of your life.I did what you couldn't do.I did it for France,for the nation that you usedto put before all else, even me.Because that is what rulers do!What is wrong with you?He is my father!There are risks that you takefor the people that you love.You used to know that.Who are you becoming?It was goodto be with Francis today.The boy truly loves me,I understand that now.I have misjudged himin so many ways.He doesn't want England.He shies from conquest.Without my constant pushing,he would be contentto hide under the covers with Mary.I can't live in fear...Or tolerate it in others.I was so close to deathtoday, I could feel...Its dark hand on my throat.But God...Spared me for the work I must do.It is for meto sit on England's throne,to slay their bastard queen,and rule a new empire!It's what I was meant for!But... Francis was right.Before... I invade England...There are thingsI must do here in France.First...I must kill my son...And wed his wife.Advertise your product or brand herecontact  today\n"

So this has been out of the Mayor'sleague from the beginning.-What's in D.C.? Or should I say who?-No T.J. you don't mean...Yes, Vince, I do. Reasons I can't thinkof our superintendent has conspiredwith the President of the United Statesto take away our playground balls.No!We can't possibly retrieve our ballsfrom the highest office in the land.No, I'm afraid we can't.For the rest of our days at school,we'll just have to make do without.You're out.I still don't get it. What wouldthe President wantwith our playground balls?-The President. Amateurs.-Butch?Yeah, it's me. And I gotta sayyou're some of the most unthoroughdetectives I ever laid eyes on.-Hey.-Easy there, T.J.I've been shadowing you,seeing all the evidence you've been seeingand to me, it all points in one direction.Think about it. Who sent you offto find those cluesin the first place, ah?-I know someone who can help.-[Butch] And those informants...-Follow the memos.-The old lady and the organ grinder.Tell me what you know.I'll point the right direction.-Nice outfits they were wearing, huh?-I liked them.Sure you did. And you liked themin the drama club's productionof \"12 Angry Organ Grindersand a German Lady\" too, didn't you?[gasps]That's right. And tell me, who has the keyto the drama club costume chest?-[all] Menlo!-Or should we call you fraulein informant?Fess up, Menlo.you were all those informants.Yeah, so get on the phoneto your little pal, the President,and get us back our balls!-Gus, it was Menlo, just Menlo.-Wasn't it?You're right. It was me,and it's my fault they took all the balls.I know you're not into sports and all,but taking away our all balls,that's kind of harsh.No, it wasn't like that.It was late last Friday.[Menlo] Principal Prickly had a tee time,so Miss Lemon had me completehis order form.Simple enough but my mind was elsewhere.Like any kid, I just wanted to get home,so I could press my tiesfor the following week.Anyway I checked the boxfor returning the old balls,but I forgot to check the boxfor delivering new ones.So, they took the old balls but never knewto bring new ones. It was a mistake.-A mistake?-Why didn't you just fess up and fix it?I'm the keeper of the permanent records.I'm not supposed to make mistakes.If the people of the school found outI made one, panic would ensue.Lighten up, Menlo.everybody makes mistakes.I like to think there are no mistakes,only lessons,as long as we face them squarelyand learn from them.I suppose you have a point.But, hey, wait a sec.If it was your mistake,how come everyone was actinglike they were trying to hide something?I guess since no one knewwho was responsiblethey were afraid the blame wouldfall on them.Wow! So even grownups don't wantto get blamed for stuff they didn't do.And by covering up my mistake, I createdthe very panic I was trying to prevent.-That was my real mistake.-So, Menlo, about those balls...Balls away![children cheering]I always knew it was justa big misunderstanding.Hey, Lawson, you ready to get whuppedat a game with all the balls?You bet I am, LaStupid.What do you say, Menlo? want to play, too?Thanks for the offer but I havea requisition form to redesign,so no one will commit my error ever again.The only ball I'm using right nowis the one in this ballpoint pen.Well, guys, I guess this all just goesto show we're only human.Indeed we are.Although, sometimes I wonder...-...is he?-[T.J.] That's a good question, GretchA question that might requiresome investigation.[bell ringing]Ah, Friday the last day of our school weekthe smell of freedom is in the air.Something else is in the air, too.Yeah, what is that?Smells kind of perfume-y.Judging by the ratioof hexanol to citroxcide,I'd say it's Claudio Puccini'slatest designer set.The Ashleys must have shown up earlyfor one of their top-secret powwows.I wonder what it's about?I'll tell you guys.It's about to get interruptedby eight hairy legs of rubbery terror.Then the issue is like totally resolved.I hereby call this emergencymeeting of the Ashleys to a close.[all] Scandalous!Rats. I'll have to get themat the front door.-Hey, Ashleys... booga, booga, booga!-Like... eek.Time to switch to a real spider.Whatever! Anyway Ashley Spinelli,you're just the girl we werelike looking for.Hey, powder puff, I told younever to call me the \"a\" word.I thought it would be all right this timesince we're like giving you these.Six ticketsto \"Wrestlerama's Reign of Pain\"?-Like enjoy, bug girl.-[all] Ha ha ha!Hey!-How'd it go, Spinelli?-The Ashleys gave me six ticketsto tonight's \"Reign of Pain\"wrestling spectacular.\"Reign of Pain\" that's got to bethe biggest sports entertainment eventto ever hit this burg.I can't believe it! These are front rowsweat-catching seats!I've always found the physics of flyingbodies most intriguing.-I don't know, guys.-What's the matter, Spinelli?Yeah, you love the wrestling.Sure, but I smell a rat, and this rat'swearing designer perfume.What do you mean?Why would the Ashleys give me ticketsto wrestling?Me and the Ashleys are like peanut butterand pickles, we just don't go together.Come on, Spinelli.You're just being paranoid.Am I, Vince? What about the timethe Ashleys secretly entered mein the little Miss Blush beauty pageant?But you won that pageant, Spinelli,and looked quite lovely doing so.Watch it, Mikey!As much as I love wrestling,I have to admit,Spinelli's making some sense.I concur. Historically speakingthe Ashleys' behavior has proven themto be extremely untrustworthy.If you ask me I say this has allthe ingredients of a dangerous,dangerous trap.[all] Mmm.Come on guys, this gesture could bethe olive branchthat forges a newand beautiful relationship.When you give up on people's abilityto do good, you give up on hope.The tickets sure do look real.Remember, Gus, that the Ashleys have nearinfinite resourcesto pull off any evil schemethey put their minds to.Yeah, the tickets could be counterfeit.It'd be pretty embarrassingto walk into the front rowand find someone else sittingin these seats.Not to mention all the troublewe'd get into for snicking inwith fake ticks.No kidding, we don't need another moviedome fiasco on our permanent records.-Clearly the Ashleys are up to something.-And I say we find out what.-We have resources of our own, you know?-We have resources?Sure, Gus, good old-fashioned ingenuity.Now let's go drink us some ice cold milk.Good idea, Teej. Uh, why milk?Let's just say it'll help us \"see\"what's up or rather, what's down.I vote for chocolate.Ugh... any more milk,and I'll bust open like Finster's cornson walk for chalk day.Don't worry Spinelli.I think we've got just enough.Behold! a genuine milk carton periscope.-[T.J] What do you see, Gus?-Pink stuff, girlie stuff, stuff stuff...Oh, there they are!OK, I see Ashley B. talking to Ashley A.Ashley A. is noddingand pointing at something.-What's she pointing at?-I'm not sure.It's something in my direction,something nearby, something. Oh!She was pointing at the periscope.No kidding, Gus. Now what do we do?Perhaps we should give upthis sordid path.The tunnel of distress only leads deeperand deeper into the cavern of despair.I'm not giving up yet, Mikey.In fact, my next plan's even better.It's a little something I sawon \"Book 'em and McVice\"the time my big sisterlet me stay up past 9:00.[all] Oh!Now, remember, Vince,you're the good kid and I'm the bad kid.Uh, hello, like, those seats are taken.They're not the only seatsthat are taken, are they?-Are they?-What are you babbling about?You have to forgive T.J.He's been working a lot of cases lately.Do I like normally talk to you boys?No, but you're going to talk now!Now, Ashley, this can go one or two ways,we can make it easy for you, or...Or I can introduce youto a world of sticky accessories!Ew! Like gross!That's right. Now why don't you tell usabout those tickets you gave Spinelli.No way. That'snone of your B.I. business,basketball brain.Basketball brain!That's right. Your brain's liketotally empty except for air.Oh! That's it. Ashley A.You're going down!Hey, now settle down, Vince.-I'm supposed to be the bad kid, remember?-I don't care. You heard what she said.She is just trying to get at you man.If you don't play this right,we're never going to crack this case.-But, but.-Chill, Vince, chill.-Yeah, I guess you're right. Thanks, man.-Geez, it's what partners are for.[door closing][Vincent] Hey, Teej, she's gone!I'm getting too old for this.-How'd it go? How'd it go?-She was good, real good.Yeah, she didn't drop a wordabout their secret plan.Perhaps is a parent actof kindness is just that.Yeah, a front row act of kindness.Guys, the Ashleys wouldn't know kindnessif it snuck up and tied theirshoelaces together.No kidding, those Ashleysare a cold calculating bunch.I don't think we'll get themto spill their plans.Maybe not to adversaries like you and me,but the Ashleys sure love to bragabout stuff to their friends.Feeling Friendly? Gretchen?-Hello, Ashleys. Anybody home?-[Ashley Q.] Like, what is it?Sorry to interrupt, but I had a fightwith Spinelli and the rest of the guysand you see, they, like,don't know anythingabout the important things in life.You know like style and fashion,but I know if I just spend some timewith you AshleysI'd like totally get it together, like.Didn't we try fixing her once before?-Like yeah. And it was a total dud.-But she is smart.[Ashley A.] Maybe she'd do our homeworkin exchange for fashion tips.[Ashley B.] Well you can't fault a girlfor wanting to trade up.[Aslley A.] All right, Gretchen G.,you may enter.-We're in.-Yes!Hey, Gretch, remember,keep an eye out for clues.What took you so long to drop those loserfriends of yours anyways?Yeah, do they all go to the samenearsighted barber,or do they just use the samecereal bowl and scissors?[laughs]-Uh, hello, Gretchen, are you listening?-Absolutely.Bad haircuts every one of them.And that T.J. boy is so rude.-Yes. Somebody should get him a leash.-Absolutely, a flea collar even.Speaking of collars, Vince sure could usea fashion consultant.Oh, yes, basketball outfitsare so out of season.-Out of season, it is basketball season.-Quiet. I can't hear all the mean stuffthey're saying about us.[Ashely A.] And that Spinelliis so beyond hopeless.She's like beyond beyond hopeless.[Gretchen] I agree. her clothingand mannerismsare a study in hopelessness.Gimme that mike, don't go writing notesyour fists can't sign.Do you hear me, Gretchen?Spinelli! come on!A purple book.Say, what's this?-Like, sorry, Ashley eyes only.-Want a molar buster?Oh, well, thank you.-Hey there's static! We're losing her!-Boost the signal!Wait. No! Stop it.I can't! Ah! Stop it, stop it!-[Ashley A.] Uh, Gretchen...-Eww, like, what kind of earring is that?I don't care how good she is at homework,she is not allowed back.Sorry about the remarks I made,but you didn't have to hurt my ear.So Gretch, what did you see in there?Well, there was some pink stuff,some girlie stuff, some stuff stuffand a large purple book on a pedestalthat they didn't want me to look at.Yeah, I remember the purple book too.They were all gathered around itright before they gave me the tickets.That's got to be where they keep all theirdangerous dangerous plans.Guys, maybe we should figure outwhere they keep their dangerous,dangerous plans later.-The wrestling match is starting soon.-Ha! As if there really is a match.You think they faked the commercials?I wouldn't put it past them.They do have fathers in high places.Then I'll take the tickets.Perhaps I can find people to go with me-who aren't so suspicious.-I'm not suspicious.Sure, Mikey, if you wanna makea fool of yourselfby walking into the Ashleys little trapyou do that.But I'm not going anywhere untilwe get to the bottom of this.-Now who's with me?-I'm always with you, Teej.-Hear, hear!-Me, too!We don't have much timeto round up four more guests.Then let's go.Don't say we didn't warn you!Now let's see about that book.Really, Gretchen, I must sayI'm not surethis is a proper useof my decoding capabilities.Don't worry, Galileo.It's all for a greater good.-We're in!-Let's do it.There it is!Gadzooks! It seems we've foundthe Ashleys' legendary charter!Charter Smarter. Let's get to the partabout the fake tickets.See if there is a chapteron dangerous, dangerous plans.No, it's just a bunch of rules and junk--\"Rules for accessorizing,rules for blush applicationRules for giving things away...\"Wait a second! what was that last one?\"giving things away\"?Yeah, let's see here.\"On the occasion an Ashley cannot,or does not wishto use a gift which she receives,and the gift cannot be returnedfor charge card credit,said gift must be passed onto another Ashley.\"What does that mean?I think it means since none of the Ashleyslike wrestling,they had to give the tickets to Spinelli.She's the only other Ashley they know.-That means the tickets are real after all-Well, shut my mouth and call me Ashley.\"Reign of Pain,\" Here we come!We got to find Mikey and Gus beforethey give away our seats. Let's go.[door closing]What was that?Galileo?Oh dear, it appears the security systemhas an elaborate timing mechanismthat I'm unable to override. Fortunately,my batteries are fully charged.I hope all of you have food.Don't tell me we're lockedin here till morning.Unless you have another wayfor me to phrase it, yes.Oh man! I should have just takenthe tickets and run.Why did I have to be so suspicious?Come on, Teej, you got to haveanother plan in you.Yeah, Teej, tell me you havea way out of here.Guys, there's only one thing we can do.[all] Help! Help!Help! Help![crowd cheers]Enough of the antics! Finish him off!Safety man, this not look safe.Don't worry, Hector, they're professionalsthey won't get hurt.This wrestling stuff sure do make peoplelike all kinds of crazy, like.Indeed, all kinds of crazy.You crazy kids are luckyus janitors don't leave till 5:00.[Gretchen] Be careful, Hank,that front tire is steel-belted.Don't worry, I almost got it. Almost[bell rings]Well, I almost got it.[bell rings]Please rate this subtitle at other users to choose the best subtitles\n"

Are you all right?- It's not funny.- It is a little.- What have you got?- Unincorporated country club...development outside of town.Scarlett Marquesa, 33, female.RIGSBY:Hostess of the party, married, one kid.Right about 10:20,the party was in full swing...Scarlett runs over the balconyclutching her throat and screaming.- She falls down to her death.- Where's the husband and the kid?RIGSBY:With neighbors. Badly shook up.LISBON: We'll wait to talk to themuntil tomorrow morning. Poison?Must be.Frothing at the lips, discoloration...medical examiner thinks so too,but we haven't found a source.We don't know whereshe injested the poison.Came from up there, but the poisoningcould've taken place anywhere. Big house.Just a moment.Excuse me.That's interesting.Look. Look at her eyes.What?Hello? Use your words.She had more mascaraon her right eye than her left...meaning she was halfway throughreapplying her makeup...when she was poisoned.So she was in...the bathroom.Ah.Ah. The source of the poison,I have no doubt.What do we got here?A motive.Mr. Marquesa. I'm Agent Lisbon, CBI.Yes.

They got along fine.Why ask about her?You're having an affairwith Asra, aren't you?What? No.JANE: No? Really?- No, really.What kind of police are you,asking me a question like that?Sorry. My mistake.- You're business partners?- She's my accounts manager.- Okay, now I understand.- Understand what?Doesn't matter. Do you knowwhere her keys are? I can't find them.I couldn't find them.I wanted to move her car.Not to worry,I'm sure they'll show up.LISBON:What is it you do for a living exactly?I develop real estate.- It's a tough market.- Tell me about it.But I'm confidentit'll turn around soon.Did Scarlett work with you?No. She was the artistic type.She made jewelry, that was her thing.Made a pretty good businessout of it in fact...selling to friends and neighbors.What kind of jewelry was it?Expensive stuff?No. Just trinkets really,earrings, bracelets.Can we see some?Sure.[MOUTHING]What?That's very nice.Was there any reasonfor the party last night?Scarlett's idea.She thought it was necessaryto let people know we're doing fine.And we are doing fine.Did anybody at the partybehave in an unusual manner?- Any odd incidents?- No.You knew everybody at the party?- Yes. Good friends.- We're gonna need a list.Sure.From the country club mostly.Scarlett was electedchair of a women's committee there.It's a big deal in this community,very prestigious.I was so proud of her...but it meant she had to spenda lot more time at the club.[OSCAR GROWLING & BANGING WALL]VICTOR:Oscar, stop. Please.Pardon me. Are we done here?Yeah, that's all for now. We'll be intouch if we need anything else.Very nice.What's your deal with Asra Hadami?Well, you saw the dinner-theater wayshe hugged Victor.She's deceiving him.I thought it was a love affair gone awry,but it's something else.She's probably stealing from him.LISBON: I'll have Van Pelt pull herfinancials same time she pulls the Marquesas'.JANE: We should go take a lookat this country club.LISBON: Yeah, talk to the women's committeeshe chairs. Bring Rigsby with you.RIGSBY:Someone here knows the truth.JANE:Oh?

We all have to go...to the chairwoman's parties.A rule.Chairwoman's a prestigiousposition, isn't it?JACKIE:Yes it is.She would make her fair shareof enemies I expect.You could say that.If you have something to say,say it.Speak your mind, bitch.Oh, okay. You want it all out there?He asked about enemiesand that's what you were.She hated Scarlettbecause she wanted to be chair...and Scarlett whipped her buttin the election.- Schooled her. Right, Mandy?- Oh, I'm not getting into this one.Right. I missed out on scoringthe private office...with all that cool stationerywith my name on it...so I killed her.Have you any ideahow idiotic you sound?- You're the idiot.- It's probably best...if we conduct interviewswith each of you separately.Do you remember anything oddhappening the night of the party?I don't know, it was just the usualmojitos and chitchat, but...- But what?- I don't know if I should tell you this...but I saw Scarlett arguingwith Asra Hadami.Looked kind of angry.Some say something more than businessmight be going on with Asra and Victor.I don't know if that's true.I don't really follow the gossip.Hm. Who does?We're told you're the gossip queenaround here.People tell me things.So...who's having an affairwith Victor Marquesa?I don't know. Who? Tell.Asra Hadami.[LAUGHING]- That's a funny idea?- No. It's just... No.Victor and Asra are good friends,nothing more.- Asra had nothing to do with this.- No?What's the general opinion?Who did this?My guess, Victor.What makes you think that?Nothing, really.Victor's a nice guy,but that's who kills women, isn't it?- Their husbands, 90 percent of the time.- Seventy percent, I think.He's right.[APPLAUSE]That's a great play.Maybe do a little more topspinon your returns, but very nice play.The answers are: Yes, I disliked her.No, I didn't kill her.You hate to lose, don't you?Yes, unlike all those many peoplethat love it.- I'm in the semi-finals, for God's sake.- Oh, of course. Good luck with that.Yeah, I have to go.I have another matchin half hour...and that toxic dwarf Mandy Riljek istrying to outbid me in the silent auction.What she needs two romantic nights for,at the Cliffside, I don't know.So I'll save us all some timeand tell you who did this, if you like.I'd like that very much.Asra Hadami.Really. Why?She's having an affair with Victor.- How do you know that?- I just have an eye for that stuff.Asra must have killed Scarlett so thatshe could have Victor for herself.Don't know why.You ask me, he's a loser.Well, thank you. Oh, by the way...if you dislike Scarlett so much,why are you wearing earrings she made?She makes good earrings.It was nice to meet you.Nice meeting you too.RIGSBY: You two were close, weren't you?JACKIE: We were very close.Being her deputy on the committee,we spoke every day.Did you notice anything differentabout your conversations?JACKIE:She talked a lot about moving away.She was so tiredof keeping up at all costs.\"At all costs\"?- Just working so hard.- Do you have a key for this?Oh, no, only Scarlett has a key.This is the chairwoman's officeand that's the chairwoman's safe.That makes sense.I don't know anything about that.And Scarlett's keys are missing.That's interesting.JANE:We need to get that safe open.LISBON: We're gonna need a search warrant.RIGSBY: I'm on it.LISBON: Did you get anythingfrom Scarlett's friends?JANE: Everybody has a theory,they're all hiding something.I don't know what.Anything from Forensicsabout the lipstick on the napkin?Not yet. They're jammed up as usual.Budget cuts.Boss, I just now got accessto Asra Hadami's financials.She cleared out her bank accountsthis morning. Checking, savings...took about $125,000 in cash.Going on the run maybe?She didn't buy any rat poison recently,did she?That would be nice, but no.No record of it.That was the Marsante Security.They found Hadami's house empty.She's gone.- Great, a fugitive.JANE: Oh, oh, oh! I know where she is.CBI.VAN PELT: Boss?LISBON: Hm?I've been here nearly six months now.Half a year.What do you want? Half a cake?I want to take leadon this interview.Okay.Okay?Yeah, sure.Thanks, boss.Why were you running, Miss Hadami?No reason. Stress.I needed space.Not the argument you hadwith Scarlett the night she died?- I didn't have an argument with her.- We hear differently.No argument.I swear. I didn't kill her.This is absurd.No more than you clearing out youraccounts and abandoning your home.Maybe I need a lawyer.Say the word. What he'll tell you,if you're not involved in the murder...best speak up.I ran because I knew the murderwould expose some issues...I'd like to keep private.Your relationship with Mandy Riljek?Exactly. News like thatcould be ruinous.True, but not the kind of thingyou abandon your house for.You said \"issues.\"What are the other issues?I didn't want to have to look Victorin the face...tell him I'd helped to run everythinghe'd worked for into the ground.How did you help do that?I borrowed moneyfrom the company's cash reserve.How much?- A little over half a million.- Where did it go?I made some poor investment choicesthat I had to cover quickly.- So you stole...- I borrowed, from the reserve.I skimmed the moneyfrom each development deal...that should have goneinto the reserve account as backup.We were making so many deals, I knewI'd get it back before it would matter.But then the dealsand the funding dried up...and suddenly that reservebecame very important.I sold anything I could get myhands on to cover the money.Hmm, take a seat.Why am I even here?I've done nothing wrong.Be with you in just one moment.Please.Well, you were found in a compromisingposition with a murder suspect.How did you knowhow to find us anyway?- You been spying on me?- You outbid Patience...for a romantic weekend,yet your husband Jim's away.And you laughed at the ideaof Victor and Asra as lovers.Nobody knows I'm here, right?- If this gets out, it'll be a scandal.- Nobody knows you're here.Sign this and you're good to go.We won't get a search warrantfor Scarlett's safe until tomorrow.Then we'll go inand tear the place apart.Oh, sorry.You didn't hear that,it's confidential.Confidential? Oh, of course.No, seriously. Don't tell anyone, okay?I understand. May I leave now?Yeah, please.Not bad. Your deliverywas a bit wooden.Wooden? Me?Yeah, and you're Marlon Brando.VICTOR: I can't believe it.Asra's been with me for over five years.I mean, she was with mein the trenches.I can't believe this.After going over your accounts,we have questions.Sure.You've talked about cash crisesin your business...but deposits have been madeinto your personal accounts.Some were upwards of $5000.VICTOR:Scarlett's deposits.Oscar, come get your lunch.Those are some pretty hefty depositsfor somebody not really working.Where did the money come from?Her jewelry business.LISBON: I thought you saidit was a small side business?It was, but recently her pieceswere getting a lot of interest.And apparently she made a dealwith a couple of boutiques.- Do you know which ones?- I never asked.VAN PELT: Without her money,you would have fallen behind months ago.I know all too well it was my wifewho had to save our butts recently.OSCAR: Dad.- What's the matter?You made it wrong.Mommy never putsall this stuff in it.She knows I like it plain.Can we make a compromise, buddy?I need to talk to thesenice police ladies.Now, I'll make it betternext time, I promise.Now would you pleasejust eat the sandwich.- Sorry about that.- It's not a problem.According to your wife's records,she traded a lot of calls...with several disposable cell phones.I don't know who she talked to.In her day-planner, she had a regularweekly date noted down...with an address in Marysville.One is scheduled for later today.- You know anything about that?- No.But she used to go to Marysville a lot forthe antique jewelry markets and stuff.[PHONE RINGS]Excuse me.- Lisbon.CHO: Results on the lipstick.No traces of DNA were found,but the color...Tongue In Cheek, is a limited editionsold in only a few high-end stores.Tongue In Cheek. That's cute.Secure access to the stores' receiptrecords so we can search through them...Then I want you to meet us at65434 East Boulevard.- It's in Marysville.- On my way.[APPLAUSE]I'll catch up to you.- Hi. Who's winning?- Hey.I don't know.I don't follow the play, to be honest.It's kind of silly, isn't it?Everybody so serious over a game.Exactly. Like it matterswho wins the trophy.I guess people feelthey need a purpose.Yeah, well, my purpose died this yearat the age of 16.Oh, I'm sorry. Boy or a girl?Girl. High as a kitewith one of her friends.She wrapped her car around a tree.Her friend got awaywithout a scratch.What was her name?Rachel.Once you lose a child, all this strivingseems kind of ridiculous, you know?Yeah, unfortunately I do.Why not leave it all behind?Just go away.I can't afford to leave.I have negative equity in my house.[APPLAUSE]Nice play, Karen.Besides, these are my friends.This is all I have.CHO:So much for jewelry.According to Scarlett's planner,the meeting is here.Let's see if we can spot the contact.I don't know, maybe we'll get lucky.- Hey, guys. What are you doing?- Nothing.CHO:Hey!MAN: What the hell are you doing, man?CHO: Hands behind your back.Let's go. Get up. Get up.This way.Should have brought some snacks.I don't see this working in a hurry.JANE:You shan't go hungry long.Mandy's newswill have spread quickly.Everyone knows that tomorrowthe safe will be opened.It's now or never for whoevertook Scarlett's keys.Hey, easy there.That is antique Mexican silver.Maybe next time you'll think beforetrying to outrun an officer of the law.I'm assuming this isn't candy.Why were you meetingScarlett Marquesa?So we could exchange beauty secrets.- You mind if I smoke?- Yeah, I do.Van Pelt, what do you got?Wardell Suggs, a.k.a. Digger. He's beenarrested for several counts of...petty theft, fraud and assault.- That's very impressive.- It could be better.Why were you meeting Scarlett?- What did she tell you about me?- Nothing. She's dead.I didn't have anything to do with that.CHO:Hey, boss, come take a look.Would you look at that.The mother lode.- Let's talk, huh?- What the hell, I got a strike to give.Scarlett was one ofmy biggest customers.Painkillers, tranquillizers, diet pills.By the hundreds.- Scarlett was dealing prescription drugs?- Yup.- Where did you two meet?- Swap meet.She was trying to sellthat God-awful jewelry.She looked desperate so I told herthere's easier ways to make money.- Were you doing a deal tonight?DIGGER: Supposed to.I've been having to listen to heryammer about quitting.Then she'd buy some bags, sayingthis is the last time she's doing it.- She'd always come back.- She was gonna quit?Yup. Matter of fact,last couple of weeks...I'm getting calls from a girlwho said Scarlett gave her my info.Same prissy kind of voice.Chick said she wanted to set upher own situation when Scarlett quit.Does this chick have a name?You know, I'm not big on namesat first, but I do have her number.Why don't you give her a call.[PHONE RINGING]Digger, why are you calling me now?In your time, ma'am,if you'd like to take a seat.Thank you so much, ma'am.How did you come to haveScarlett Marquesa's keys?I took them when I went to offermy condolences to Victor.Naughty, I know, but I couldn't wait.It's not naughty. It's a felony.You wanted your hands on her pills.Nonsense. I opened that safeout of idle curiosity.I had no ideathere were any pills in there.I simply wanted to measurethe windows for new drapes.- I'll be the next chair of the committee.- Why not wait till it's official?Am I here because of keys?Explain the nature of yourrelationship with Wardell Suggs.- Who?- Digger.- I liked his jewelry.- Okay.You aware Scarlett Marquesawas selling illegal drugs...- in the Villa Marsante Estates?- Who didn't know?Well, except for you all.RIGSBY: If everyone knew, then why didn'tanyone come forward?And risk being ostracized or caught upin the vulgarity of it all?- Not likely.- She was doing a booming business.You wanted to be part of it.Maybe a little too much.So I killed her? Please.Hello, she was a drug dealer.People she dealt with must havedone her in. Other dealers.Or a highly capable rival straight inthe middle of her own community.You have found no drugs or poisonon me or in my home.The keys weretaken after she was killed...and I only opened that safeout of idle curiosity.You taped togetheryour whole theory...with a couple of random conversationsI've had with a drug dealer.Does that about sum it up?When she puts it like that,it does seem thin.Yep. She's a piece of work, isn't she?We'll have to cut her loose,but discreet surveillance...might help our cause.If you're thinking of tryingthat on, don't. Not your shade.What do you think aboutolder women?I don't think about older women.- My mother's an older woman.- Not old old, just older, you know.Older than you.Why are you asking?You trying to set me up with somebody?Look up the availablescientific evidence on the Internet.They have less hang-ups, like themselvesmore than younger woman...and they're at their sexual peak.That's what the research says anyhow.What the hell happened to youat that country club?Nothing. I'm just saying that...She's spotted us.Afternoon, boys.I was making myself a paniniand thought I'd bring you some.- Thanks, ma'am.- Oh, and just so you know...I'm headed to the club for a massage.So you don't need to follow too close.Relax, have a bite to eat first.I'll see you there.Yes, ma'am.\"Yes, ma'am. Thank you, ma'am.\"What is wrong with you?- She surprised me.- What's in the sandwiches?It's a panini, if you don't mind.- It's ham and cheese.- Yeah, who knows what else.VICTOR:My God.Drugs?I can't believe it.Using jewelry sales as a cover, your wifewas dealing prescription drugs.Painkillers mostly. Speed. Diet pills.Some of them were coming from Mexico,others were stolen from pharmacies.You seem genuinely surprised. A lot ofpeople around here knew about it.I had no idea.- Think I had something to do with this?- She was moving a lot of inventory.I had nothing to do with this.How could you not knowshe was medicating...- half the women in the neighborhood?- She lied to me.Maybe she was just tryingto protect me from the shame.Or maybe it was easierjust to turn a blind eye...- as long as the money was coming in.VICTOR: No.I didn't know that she was doing this.- Hi. I'm Patrick.- Oscar.You wanna talk, Oscar?- Pretty heavy stuff going on, right?- Yeah.- I'm sorry about your mom.- Me too.My dad is sad because youguys can't find who did it.But I don't mind about that.I just want her back.She can't come back.You know that, don't you?I know that. I'm 9.I won't ever see her againuntil I'm dead too.- Then I'll go stay with her in heaven.- Well, that sounds good.But you know what I notice you're reallygood at that could help you now?What?Make-believe.- Yeah, I am.- You are, very good at it.You wanted to talk to your mum...you could make-believeshe was here.- I do it all the time.- To my mom?No, not your mum. I talk to my wife.- She's dead?- Yeah. Yeah.But I talk to her all the time.You should try it. It's very good.- I guess.- Well, whatever.This is cool.- You any good with these?- I'm okay.Oh, really?En garde.OSCAR:I got you.[OSCAR & JANE SHOUTING]Please, mercy. Mercy.Fair maiden. D'Artagnan, I have to go.Goodbye.RIGSBY:Ugh. Spa stuff takes forever.How long can a massage be?They do all sorts of thingsbesides a massage.- Facials, waxing, mud.- How do you know so much?I bought a certificate for my mom.Wayne. You're back again. How nice.Hi, Mrs. Shaper.Now, you knowyou must call me Jackie.And it's \"Ms.\" not \"Mrs.\"- Divorced.- Sorry...- Jackie.- He was a good man.But weak, essentially.He just couldn't seem...- What are you wearing on your lips?- Excuse me?- The color. What color is this?- Tongue In Cheek.- You like it?- Where did you get it?Bought it at the boutique in town.- How long have you been wearing this?- Just bought it today.I saw it on Patience Broadbent atScarlett's party. I just had to have it.- A crazy price, but what the heck.- Positive it's Tongue In Cheek?I have it right here.You saw Patience wearing itat Scarlett's party?Is that a pickup line?WOMAN 1:Ah! Ah! Ah!WOMAN 2:Oh, my God.No detectable prints on the knife.- Surveillance tapes?- Spa didn't believe in them.Something to do withdisturbing the chi.I don't get it.Why kill Patience? Why now?Perhaps it's part of the planall along.No, this was hasty.Patience became a new target.Revenge for Scarlett's death?Victor was quick to anger.Rigsby, find out Victor Marquesa'srecent whereabouts.Could be the competitionwiping out the dealer...and her heir apparent. Or...Or what?Victor does fit nicely, doesn't he?Can you believethat Patience got stabbed?It's like a mafia hit.I am never going in that spa again.I will tell you that.Tragic set of events.I didn't see it coming.So, what, you think this issome kind of drug war?It could be, but stabbingsare usually crimes of passion.- This is very personal.- So, what's next?CBI are alreadyputting the pieces together.In fact...- Never mind.- What?No, I shouldn't talk about itbecause it's still an ongoing case.You can't just leavesomething like that hanging.I'm gonna get myselfin a lot of trouble.Oh, come on, girls.All right, listen, can you promise methat this will just stay between us?- Yes, of course.- You promise?- We're going after Victor Marquesa.- Victor?I don't believe it.He doesn't look like the type.HEATHER:On what grounds?We think he killed Patience out ofrevenge for the murder of his wife.You said there was no proofPatience was guilty.I guess Victor didn't wantto wait around for proof.What's going to happen to Oscar?Mother murdered,now dad's a murderer.They arrest the father,he'll be placed in foster care.Oh, how dreadful.- That poor child.- Yes.- I guess they couldn't keep a secret.LISBON: I guess they can't.Let's do it.- It's gonna be all right, son. I promise.OSCAR: Dad!- No! Where are you going?VICTOR: It's gonna be okay.- Don't worry, I'll be right back.- No! Dad!- Dad.VICTOR: It's okay.OSCAR:Come back! No!Dad! Dad!- Stop. You have to stop this.- Can't. This is justice being served.Look what you're puttingthat boy through!- He'll forget eventually. It's fine.- No, he won't.- It's fine.- No, it's not.- Why?- Because I did it. I killed them.I killed them both.Oh, God.[HEATHER CRYING]I suspected it was youbecause everybody else...at the clubwore some of Scarlett's jewelry.- But not you.- That's it?- Jewelry?- The more we talked...the more I felt your pain and anger.Losing your daughterhas unhinged you.Unhinged.Yeah.I suppose it has.My daughter...Rachel...she loved to dance.Didn't matter what kind of music either,a toe would start tapping.She was just so full of life.She had taken several painkillers withalcohol before she got behind the wheel.One of her neighborhood friendsgot them from her mother...who got them from Scarlett.I understand your anger.It was like theyripped my soul out clean.But the rest of the worldjust kept moving right along.Like I was the only onewho remembered what happened.So when I saw herflitting about town...selling her pills without a carein the world...still hosting parties at her house...dancing around without a stitchof the misery I was carrying, I snapped.I killed her.I didn't want any other personto have to experience what I did.[COUGHING]And Patience?She told everyone at the clubnot to worry...she was gonna take over Scarlett'sbusiness and keep the pills coming.Like nothing had happened.Like no lessons had been learned.I had to finish what I started.I had to.I'll get this transcribed for you to sign.And now that it's done,does it feel better?It doesn't change a thing.VICTOR: Agent Lisbon.- Mr. Marquesa. Hi.I want to thank you and your team.Although the scene in front of the house...- It was make-believe, Dad.- Sorry.The make-believewas a bit unorthodox and unpleasant...- but you all know what you're doing.LISBON: Most of the time.I wanna apologizeif we were tough on you.No, it's what I needed to hear.We're moving out of Villa Marsante,headed back to my hometown.My son and Ihave a lot of catching up to do.- Take care.- Thanks.Mr. Jane.- Thank you.- No, it's nothing. Forget about it.Take care. Good luck.Bye.Another minuteand I would've missed them.- I hate it when people say thank you.- Why?He likes to play the Lone Ranger.\"Who was that masked man?I never got a chance to thank him.\"Exactly.Uh, I don't want to alarm you,but Jackie...has just walked in behind you,and she is looking fierce.Oh, I know. I asked her out to dinner.[ENGLISH SDH]\n"

How are you an Avenger?\"\"\"Why are you time traveling with Captain America?\"\"\"That doesn't make sense.\"A lot has changed about my life. But everywhere I go, people ask me the same thing.Can you take a picture with my dog?\" \"\"Scott, what about now?\"\"\"What's next?\"\"\"Where does the ride take you?\" If I knew that, it wouldn't be a ride.All right.-  -  -It's been a crazy few years. For everyone. -Hey, hi. How are you?Everything is ready for you.You're too much. No, no, no.Your money's no good here.- --Are we still talking about that? -Yes, of course. Rubin, you are the best. Thank you, Spider-Man.So, let's make time for the stuff that really matters.Like friends.Friends you didn't even know you had.  \"\"Remember the people who got you here.You couldn't have done it without them. Hey, I'm just a guy who got fired from Baskin-Robbins.Sometimes you just get lucky. I'm lucky I met Hope Van Dyne.I think you know who she is.She's taken back her dad's company.Now she's using the Pym Particle for global change.A lot of people say they want to save the world...but Hope, she saves it every day.Thank you.Thank you so much.  Reforestation. Affordable housing. Food production.She's not wasting a second.I still can't believe it.None of this should have happened.But it did.It's a pretty good world.I'm glad we saved it.\"Do I miss the action?\"Sometimes. \"Will I be there when the Avengers need me?\"Absolutely.\"I'd never turn my back on them. \"But right now, the only job I want is being a dad. \"I love you, Cassie.\"Thanks for being my hero. \"And I'm sorry I missed some birthdays.\"And for the rest of you kids out there...\"word of advice.\"Look out for the little guy.\"Make mistakes.\"Take chances.\"Because if there's one thing life's taught me... \"there's always room to grow.\" Sorry, that's me.Why is jail calling?Lang!- --Lang! -I'm here. All right, come on. Let's go.Come on. Hey. Is she okay? Have you heard anything?Not yet. No.   Hi, Hope. Hey, Dad. Cassie. What happened?Sign here.You know, just jail stuff.Give it back.I know it was you.Are you sure?I mean, it was kind of hard to see...through all that tear gas you fired into the park full of peaceful protestors.Where is it? I'm sorry. This must be really embarrassing for you.I did find this though.You shrank a cop car?What were you thinking?What was I supposed to do? Look the other way?They were clearing out a homeless camp in the middle of the night.- --No, I'm not saying that... -And where do they expect them to go?It's not their fault that they lost their homes in the Blip.I know that. No one can even afford rent right now, unless you're some trust-fund asshole.I'm not telling you what to do.- --I'm just saying... -Telling her what to do.Telling me exactly what to do. No, you do what you want.I'm suggesting another way to do it.Okay.You know, I promised your mom...that you would only use this stuff when one of us was around.It's really dangerous tech.I know it's dangerous.What if the cops took it from you? What if you lost it?I didn't lose the suit.You have a suit? Wait, you have a suit? I know how to take care of myself, okay? Trust me. I'm pretty good at it by now.Ouch.-  --I didn't mean it like that. I'm sorry. -I know. That's okay. It's all right.I get it.I just think you should get to have a normal life. Dad, a guy dressed like a bee...tried to kill me in my room when I was six.I've never had a normal life.How about some music? \"And in that moment, all I could think was...\"'How did the Hulk turn me into a baby?\"'Will I be a baby forever?\"'Am I the Hulk's baby?'\" Dad, are you listening to your own book?- - -\"But I was ready for anything. -Hmm? No, that's...- --It's just the radio. -\"Steve and I grew close over that.\"-  --Dad, turn it off. -It's so weird. Something's wrong with this switch. It won't turn off.I said turn it off.What's that? Turn it up? All right. \"A little after that, a raccoon from space showed up.\"I don't think he knew my name. \"I was just happy to meet a raccoon who could talk.\"Excuse me.Thank you.All right.Your Nobel Prize is in the mail. It better be. I just saved eight bucks. God, I admire you.Thank you.I missed this.No pizza in the Quantum Realm? No. No anything. You know, Mom, you can talk about it.If you want. Sweetheart, I spent 30 years down there.I wanna live right now. So, Cassie, did you make any new friends in the slammer this time?Grandpa.\"This time\"?Was there a last time?I mean, last time barely counts.I didn't know that.Why didn't you call me?'Cause I knew you'd be like this.I would've just broken you out with ants. All right, you know what? Family meeting.Can we have a family meeting?Isn't that what we're doing?Yeah, I mean about this.About everybody being so fine with this.  Look, you wanna help. I get it.  I do, Cassie. I really do.But I don't want you wasting your life.At least I'm still trying to do something with mine.I literally saved the world.Oh, did you?Well, yeah, you never mentioned that before. Hey, everybody, Scott saved the world. How was that for you, Scott?You should write a book about it. Ha ha. Hilarious. Yeah, you're welcome for all not being dust.And what do you do now?Sign books?Aren't you the guy who broke into VistaCorp?Aren't you the guy who flew all the way to Germany...just to fight Captain America at the airport?Fight with Captain America at the airport.Wouldn't fight Captain America.Not insane. People still need help, Dad.At least we're trying to do something that matters.\"\"Who's \"we\"?What are you three up to?Science.With ants.Ant science.I don't believe you.Let's just show him.What are they building?Are you doing this? Actually, no, they built their own tech.Pretty smart ants. Okay, so when you were all... like, gone those five years, I had a lot of time.And I started reading Grandpa Hank's old journals... and I got really into the Quantum Realm and...The Quantum Realm? I know we all have a history there, and I didn't want to freak anyone out...but we've been talking about it. She had some questions, okay? I can't help if people are inspired by me.So, you've been studying the Quantum Realm?Why didn't you ask me about it? I tried, Mom.A lot.You never wanted to talk about it.Cassie's just been curious...and we gave her some pointers.  This isn't exactly ant science, is it, Henry?You know how dangerous the Quantum Realm is. Yeah, we all do, Mom.Nobody's going to the Quantum Realm.That's why we made this.It's like a satellite for deep space or the ocean.But Quantum.We just need a map.And then we can study and explore the entire Quantum Realm.Never even have to go.Your daughter built a subatomic Hubble Telescope in a basement.You know, if I had something like this when you were gone...then I could have found you.It's amazing.I'm blown away.How does it work?It's kinda like that two-way radio we used to have.You send a signal down from here...and then it collects the data, and it sends it back.Wait. Wait a minute.You're sending a signal down to the Quantum Realm?Yeah.- --Shut it down now. -Janet...- --Why would we shut it... -What's wrong?You have to turn it off! Stop and tell us what's wrong!Janet?There's something I should have told...Dad?No!- --No! -Mom!No!Damn it!Dad?Dad!Dad!Cassie.Dad! Oh, Dad. Come on.Okay.Are you okay?Yeah. I'm okay.Where are we?Mom!Dad! Hope. Over here.Are you okay?We should be dead.Why aren't we?I don't know.Are we where I think we are? I would say yes...but it wasn't like this.Janet!Mom!Janet!Mom!Do not move.We need to find Scott and Cassie.Right now.Hope? Hope?Hank? Can you hear me?- --Can anyone hear me? -Oh, my God.- --It's okay. -What are we gonna do? It's okay. It's okay. We're okay. We're okay. It's gonna be okay.\"\"You're saying \"okay\" too much.  Okay. All right. Okay. Well, it's 'cause we are.We're okay.We are fine. Hey, we're gonna find them, and we're gonna go home.In the meantime, look around.It's beautiful.All right? We're outside. It's like we're camping. We love camping.We've never been camping.But we've always talked about it.Is that sun moving?Get back!Oh, my God.I don't think this is a sun!It's fine.- --Dad! -Honey, it's okay.Still okay. Dad. Oh, my God.That was weird.Run.There's Quantum people in the Quantum Realm?Yeah.I didn't know that either. What was that back there, Mom?What was that ship looking for?Keep your voice down.You said there was nothing down here.Why didn't you tell us about all of this?  Hope, I will explain everything, but right now...- --I just need you to trust me. -Then make me trust you! Let's just calm down, all right? We can talk about this... We don't have time to talk, Henry.No, you need to tell us what's...Why didn't you listen? I told you to stay away from here. Janet, I'm so sorry. I should have told you what we were doing. I had no idea... I know. It's...We'll talk later.Right now, we stick together...we find Scott and Cassie... and we go home. Okay?- --Okay?- --Okay.Stay close.This is incredible.I've studied the Quantum Realm for years.Why didn't I see any of this?You weren't able to look deep enough.Not through the Void and Subatomica.There are worlds here...worlds within worlds.It's a place outside time and space.It's a secret universe...beneath ours.Hey, get your hands off me!Cassie?Where's my daughter?Where is she?Cassie?Where's my daughter?Cassie!Dad!Cassie!Drink the ooze.What?I'll handle this.Mom.Was that a good stab?I got us a ride.He's friendly.Quite a ride.Says the man who invented flying on the back of an ant.I like ants. And I love that you love them. Here.These will help us blend in.Where exactly are we going on this?We're not too far from an old friend of mine.If anyone's heard where Scott and Cassie are...it'll be him.After you. Saddle up, Ant-Man.Let me go! Let me go!I don't know what you're saying!I don't know what you...No! No!Drink the ooze!Drink the ooze!Drink the ooze!Drink the ooze!Hello.Hi. Hi.Did you drink the ooze?Why can I understand you? Great. That's the ooze. Hey, everybody, it worked! Ooze worked!We can finally be friends. Hi. I am Veb.You just drank me.I did... What?Do you need some more ooze? Here.- --I can pour some ooze into your hole... -No, I'm okay.- --I'm okay. I'm okay. -Oh, wow!A big hole.How many holes do you have? I'm sorry. Is that a personal question?I don't have any holes.His name is Scott Lang.He has seven holes.Yeah, that's right.How did you know that? He's Quaz. He's a telepath.You can read minds? Yeah, and I really wish I couldn't.Everyone is disgusting.- --Could you please stop thinking that? -Sorry.- --Please, stop. -Thinking?- --Thinking that. -I'm trying. Well, not very hard. And I think you look weird too. I don't think you look weird. I think you look really cool.I wish my head glowed. No, no, you don't. I know I don't. I'm nervous, okay? And it just came out.What are you doing here?- --Are you a spy? -What? No. No, no.We should torture him. Guys. No, it's okay. We're not spies. He's my dad.- --Thank you. -Welcome.Then who is San Francisco?- --It's where we're from. -It's a place.Then what's Earth?It's also where we're from.We should torture them.Why are you always trying to torture people? We have other options. Do things come out of your holes, like milk, juice... Veb, stop asking about his holes.Some of us have holes.What are you doing here?Where are you from?- --Okay. -Up there. Up there.- - -See, above this, it's a different universe. -The Earth. Big Earth.-  - -It's the same universe, but it's bigger. -This is Earth, but it's a very small Earth.- --Sometimes, I guess. -I get big. I shrink.- --And it's like... -But I wrote a book about it, actually.- --I don't know. -This is the Quantum Realm.You have to shrink to get in the Quantum Realm.-  --We shrunk. Right now, we're really small. -It's bigger where we're from.- --So, we're small right now. -It's bigger. Okay, they're telling the truth.It doesn't matter.You come from above.Like him.So, he is hunting you.He will burn the world to find you.Who?The Conqueror. There are beings down here. Intelligent beings. I always theorized it was possible, but to be here...a subatomic universe.This changes everything we know about life... evolution, our place in the galaxy...Holy shit!That guy looks like broccoli.Keep your head down.Follow me.Drink those.I'll be right back.I'm here for Krylar.It's you. Let's keep that between us.And Krylar.Hello.I don't know your ways or customs...but I assume that you have a beverage that can get me drunk? Absolutely, sir.So, what's your story then?God.Move.It's time.Follow me.Right this way.How exactly do you know this guy?Old freedom fighter friend of mine. Sorry, you were a freedom fighter?Or terrorist.Depends on who you ask.  But, trust me, he can help.Janet Van Dyne?I thought you were dead. Been a long time, Krylar.Officially, Lord Krylar now.I fought like hell against that.It sounds so elitist.You have got to be Hank.I've heard so much about you and your ants.What are ants anyway?Do we have 'em down here?I don't think so. No.That's too bad.Hope.You have to be Hope.She talked about you every day.That's strange...she never said anything about you.I don't think I would have told my kid either.- --Wild stuff. -Funny.How wild?  Very wild, Henry. Yeah. Krylar, we need your help. Janet, after all we've been through, together...just ask me.Tell me, how can I help?But...is anyone starving? I'm starving.Boys...Now.They don't know anything.About... anything.Then get them out of here.Excuse me.  Look, he's right. I don't know what's going on.We're just trying to find our family.Do you have a map?All we wanna do is go... Wait, wait. Don't shoot.They're with us.Is that building alive?Yours are dead? Look. Excuse me.We just wanna go home.At least you still have a home.What happened here?The Conqueror burned our homes.Our stories.He built his citadel on the bones of our people.Some of us escaped...found others on the run.We gathered who we could to fight.It was never enough.I'm sorry.We can help.- - -Cassie... -Dad, you're an Avenger.They need help. No. What I need to do is get you home.Why don't you wanna help?We don't know anything about this place.I mean, I don't even know how time works down here.Have we been gone for 10 seconds?Or have we been gone for 10 years?Think about your mom right now.- --Can you imagine what she must be... -Don't use Mom as an excuse.- - -You just don't care. -No, I do care.I know you wanna help. I do.But this is not our fight. Just 'cause it's not happening to you doesn't mean it's not happening.Hey.Would you look at me?She's disappointed in you. I got that. Yeah. Thank you.You're welcome.We'll talk about it later.Right now, let's just find the others.No one knows this place better than Janet.What did you say?What?That name.Janet Van Dyne.Where is she? That's what we're trying to find out. You know her?I know her.She shouldn't be here. Hey, bring a round of the chasers, please. Yes, thank you. If you haven't had this, don't try it...unless you want to change your life. Krylar, we're looking for friends of ours.Two of them.Human, like us. Human, that's the word.Totally forgot what you call yourselves up there.Human.Are you not human? Not technically, but yes.In the ways that matter.No!Let us talk. So, what is it that brings you to us, Janet? If I remember correctly, you left.You left all of us.With him. Janet, what is he talking about?You didn't tell them about him.Did you say anything...about what you did here?How many people died because of you?Does your family even know who you are?Your mommy...is full of secrets.You're lying.I lie.A lot.Not about this.Let them go.He just wants me.But you want them.So they're coming too.Along with those other friends of yours.I heard about them.But he did too.And he sent the Hunter.What kind of hunter?Not a man. Not a machine. A mechanized organism designed only...for killing.Where are they?No clue.Dead.Probably dead. This is so sad when all of this... could have been avoided, Janet.Just give him what he wants.What happened to you?We fought against him.He can be very persuasive.Let's pay him a visit.I think we're done here.Can that ship get us out of here?Cover me?Always. Henry, take the helm.I'm gonna hot-wire this thing.Where are the controls?Those are the controls.What the hell? You'll be great. It's like flying a bike.Is the bike alive?Hands, all the way in!Like stuffing a turkey.-  --Really, him? -He used to be charming.That guy? I was down here for 30 years, Henry.- --I had needs. -Oh, my God. Look, I get it. I've got needs too.Oh, my God!I had dinner with someone a few times.Her name was Linda.It didn't work out.What went wrong? She wasn't you, baby.-  --Get everyone in the ships. We're leaving. -All right.- --And, Xolum. -Right here. Take them as far away from here as you can.- --Why? -What? If you're looking for Janet, he's looking for you.You led them straight to us.Come on, come on.Take as many as you can.We'll hold them off.Go!Come on! Hurry, hurry!We gotta go! We gotta go!Get on. Get on now!We have to go now. Now!Oh, my God! Cassie, let's go!Get to the sanctuary.Wait for my message.-  - -Veb, we're leaving. -No. No, wait!- --Move! Move! -All my friends.Give up the travelers.The Conqueror will show you mercy.I know his mercy. Stay here. I'm...Cassie?Oh, no. Okay. I have a suit. Yeah, I noticed.- --You okay? -Yes.  Look, momentum, right?   Jump, tap, right? One move. Jump, tap. I know how to do it, Dad.- --Do you? Really? -Yes.'Cause it didn't look like it from my end.I messed up on the timing.Jump...Like that.You see what I did? You see what I did? No. You're like this small.I jumped and tapped. Jentorra, we have to go.Get to the ship! Welcome back to the Quantum Realm, Scott.I've been waiting a long time for this.What?Is someone in there?Oh, yes.The destiny you cannot escape.Our fates have always been forged together...ever since that day we met.Scott Lang.Get away from us!The day you broke me.- --Banished me down here. -Wait.Darren?Surprised to see me?Yeah.It's the bee guy?- --It's the bee guy? -Cassie?I almost didn't recognize you.How are you not dead?I became the ultimate weapon.That's what this is? Look, Darren.Darren is dead!There is only M.O.D.O.K.! And there's no place you can run, Scott.Not from me.And not from him.He's the future.He's the past.And now all he needs is you.Mom?What's after Scott and Cassie?We have to find them.There's something I have to do first.They could be dead! Hope, please.And you're still hiding things from us.I am trying to protect you.From what?Who are you so afraid of?Third time in jail?Four.And here we are again.Face to face.That's a face.It's a big face.Why are you just a floating head? Maybe you could walk us through this, Darren.You left Darren to die in the Quantum Realm.But the Conqueror found me.Rebuilt me.Made me the ultimate weapon. A mechanized organism designed only for...M.O.D.O.K.? I get it. It's an acronym.It's an acronym. Mechanized organism designed only for killing.Actually, that's M.O.D.O.F.K.- --I bet you thought you'd seen the last of me. -Just now noticing the baby legs.They're not baby legs.A little bit like a Bjrn.You think you're so smart. Scott Lang, the man who took everything from me.Who stole my whole life.But I did it.I got you here. I found your signal, Cassie. Thanks for that, by the way. Couldn't have done it without you.You're looking at a man set free.I've created so much more here than you could possibly imagine.All for him.I wasn't the only one stranded in the Quantum Realm.What is this place?He said he was a traveler. A scientist who crashed off course.He had a ship...beyond anything I had ever seen.A ship that could travel the Multiverse.The Multiverse?As in alternate dimensions?Parallel realities?I didn't believe it at first.But it's real.Just like we theorized.Can this take us home?It can take you anywhere.I'd never met anyone like him.He felt so...lost.I guess we both were.But we had a way out.We tried everything...to recharge his ship's energy core.Nothing worked. But after so many years alone, it was nice to have a friend.I lied to Hope.I told her I was coming home.I can see her by the door.Waiting for me.That's the last thing I did...was lie to her.I just thought I'd have more time.I can give that to you.Time.It's not what you think it is.It's a cage.And it does everything it can...to break you.It's not until you free yourself from it that you see...just how small...it always was.We're going to get out of here.She's gonna open the door...and you'll be there.I promise.- --Let's get to work. -Okay. It took ages, but we did it.We brought it back to life.Let's go home.His ship was neurokinetic.Connected to his thoughts.When I touched it...I saw his mind.I felt...what he had done.Entire worlds...entire timelines. Gone, like they never even existed.Janet?We can leave.Right now.Who is Kang?Who I need to be.He didn't crash here.He was exiled here.Outside space and time.The only place...that could hold him.Exiled?By who?I don't know.But they sabotaged his ship.And trapped him here.And because of me...he was getting out.Janet?Stay away.You saved my life.I made a promise.Just let me take you home.And then?What are you going to do?Win. I told you time isn't what you think.I can make it...so you never left her.Hope is going to open the door...and you'll be there.And how many worlds will die...if you get out?Not yours.She'll never know.Don't you want to see your daughter again?I can't let you leave.Why do you think you can stop me? Give it to me, Janet.Give it to me! I couldn't beat him. He was too powerful.What did you do? I'm sorry, Hope.No!I blew up his core.Cut him off from time.And trapped us both down here forever.But I gave him back enough.Now that he had his suit back...he became what he always was.A conqueror.He's got weapons and technology...centuries beyond anything we can dream of.He took his prison and made it his empire.I spent years fighting him... running from him, hiding from him.And then you saved me.You brought me home.But I didn't deserve it.I unleashed a monster on this place...and ran away. Janet, you couldn't have known. I'm sorry I never told you.I just wanted to forget.I just wanted to be your mom again. I'm so sorry you had to go through all of that alone.But you are not alone now.We'll stop him together.He's after the core.But he needs Pym Particles to reach it.And if he's got Scott and Cassie, he's got Pym Particles.- --And a head start. -Exactly.- --We gotta get out of here. -Hope.He cannot get out.You're an interesting man...Scott Lang.I don't know who you are...but you've made a big mistake.Okay?I'm an Avenger.I've called the other Avengers...You're an Avenger?Have I killed you before?What?They all blur together after a while.You're not the one with the hammer?No, that's Thor.We get confused a lot. Similar body types. Who are you?Just a man...who's lost a lot of time.Like you.But we can help each other with that.M.O.D.O.K. tells me you're a good thief. Yeah, he stole something from me. Do not speak when I am in the room. Gotta say, Janet was a lot more helpful.You know Janet too?Does everyone down here know Janet?She didn't tell you about me?I guess that's not a surprise.Janet stole something from me.My ticket out of here.And you're the only one who can steal it back.And why would I do that?Because you want to get out of here.And I need to get out of here.Because I know how it ends.How what ends?All of it.I don't live in a straight line.And with time...it's hard...not to skip to the end.So, if you want to stop what's coming...and trust me...you do...I am the only shot you have.What's coming?Me.A lot of me.They exiled me, down here.They're afraid of me.But I'm the man who can get you home.So, do we have a deal?No, I don't think we do.Dad!Let me make this easy for you.You will bring me what I need...or I will kill your daughter in front of you...then make you relive that moment... over and over again in time, endlessly...until you beg me to kill you.Do we understand?Don't do this.I'm a man who likes to be understood.Dad.Don't listen to him.No! No! Look, we can talk about this.Don't do it!You really should do it.Please. That's my daughter, please.Do you want her to live, or do you want her to die?Please!You think I'm lying?Do I look like a liar to you?Stop!- --Dad! -I'll do it. I'll do it. I'll do it. Just let her go.Let her go. Let her go!You're out of your league.Ant-Man.Just be glad I need you.Don't touch her again.Then give me what I need.Where is it?What is that?It was a multiversal engine core.A power source that can take you anywhere in space and time.Then Janet blew it up.It's in that?It is that.And we have to get to the center.That's good to know.You'll have to shrink down and pass through the eye of the storm.Once you're inside, find the core...and size it back down.What does it look like?When I steal something, I usually know what I'm stealing.You'll know it when you see it.Get in and out as fast as you can. The longer you're in there, the more your mind will come undone.Better hurry.Dad!I'm sorry.This is all my fault.Hey, hey, hey.No.I messed up.Cassie.My whole life happened because I messed up.The only thing I didn't mess up is you.Dad!It's okay.It's okay. I love you, Peanut.I love you too. Okay. I'm in. Darren, can you hear me?Darren?Darren? M.O.D.O.K., can you hear me?What?- --I'm in. -Okay. Okay, so what do I do? What's the plan?Don't die?  Thanks. Big help, M.O.D.O.K.Do you see it? Yeah. I see it.I'm heading in.What the hell?What the hell?What the hell?  I told you, Scott. Getting in was just the beginning.You never said that.Why am I looking at another me? I'm not another me. You're another me.You just came out...Why am I looking at another me?You're looking at the possibility of another you.You're in a Probability Storm.What does any of that mean?- --You don't know? -Why would I know?Because you got me in here. So, I am the real one, huh? No. I didn't say that.- --What the hell?- --What the hell?- --Wait. Wait, wait. -What the hell?What the hell?What is this place?It's a Probability Storm.Every choice you could make, existing all at once.What is he saying? What's he saying?- --What's he saying? -You're inside Schrdinger's box.And you're the cat.- --That doesn't make sense. -Oh, I get it.Nobody move! All right? Nobody move!Why should we listen to you? You're not even the real one.- --What the hell? -Am I real?- --Am I real?- --I am the real one! -What the hell? What the hell. I'm the real one. Guys. Hey, relax. Take it easy. Breathe. We'll figure this out. Together.Who are you?Why are you dressed like that?Because I work at Baskin-Robbins.This is my uniform.These are normal clothes.Why are you dressed like that?-Do you have ice cream? -Enough!Let's do this!Oh, we're all gonna die.Wait.Wait. Wait!No! No!No! Wait! No!I've got a read on Scott.Out of the way!-  --Mom! What is this? -What are you doing? Don't look at them. They're just possibilities.They're not you. Scott, where are you?Why am I here? Don't worry. It'll work this time. What are you... Wait, wait, no, no. Stop.- --Stop! No! -I got this, guys.I got this! I got it! Scott, where are you?Scott! Where are you, Scott?- --I can't breathe. -Ow, that's my neck.Stop kicking me!-! --My back! -We're all gonna die!Dad.Come back.Dad...if you can hear me... come back. Just come back.- --Don't give up. -Come on.-  --Dad, just come back one more time. -Come on.- --She needs us. -Please.  -Yes, come on. -Come back. -She needs us. Let's do it together.- --Get him up! Get him up! -Grab him! Grab him!Let's go.-  --Come on, lift him! -Yes!- - -I got ya, I got ya! Go. -Come on. That's it.- --Come on! -Give him a boost! Give him a boost! Come on, we're doing it for Cassie! Fellas, let's go!Everyone together!What are you doing?How are you able to do that?I'll tell you how.We all want the same thing. And I'm coming, Cassie. Go get her, pal.Everyone, let's go!Come on! Come on, closer.Get him higher!Hang on, guys, hang on. Careful. Steady, steady. Steady. That's it.Let's go.What?- --Oh no. -What happened? Did it work? Sorry, buddy!- --No, no, no. Hope, are you real?I'm real.Then let's do this.You ready?Ready.Come on.We gotta get that thing out of here. No, no, no. Wait.He's got Cassie.- --What? -Scott.- --Janet. -Give that to me.- --We have to go now. -No.He's got Cassie. We will save her. I promise you we will save her...but you cannot give that to him.I wouldn't trust her.Janet has a way of...changing her mind. Hello, Jellybean.So... what's it gonna be, Scott?Well, well.If it isn't my old mentor. Hi, Hank.Darren?Didn't expect to see your protg again after all... Holy shit, Darren.What happened to you?I'm the ultimate weapon!Do I need to take it?Where is my daughter?Scott.Don't.We had a deal. She'll be fine without you. So long, Hank.Henry.You left me right here to die.Let's see how they do.What did you see?We didn't really get a chance to talk about it last time.But I always wondered.When you touched my mind...what did you see?A monster...who thinks he's a god.When you can see time the way I do...you don't get to close your eyes.And you're the only one who sees?I am the only one that can see it's broken.And who broke it?I did.Every version of me.My variants.Throughout the Multiverse.Playing with time, like children.But I saw how it ends.I saw their chaos...spreading across realities.Universes colliding.Endless incursions.I saw the Multiverse.And it was dying.All because of them.So, I took control.You mean you started a war.And now you wanna wipe away any universe that's a threat to you.That's what monsters do.That's what conquerors do.They burn the broken world.And they make a new one.You don't care about saving anything or anyone. You only want revenge because they beat you.Because you lost.I have lost.You have no idea what I have lost.And I will burn them out of time...for what they've done to me.You'll be wiping out entire timelines.Murdering trillions of people. I wish that mattered, Janet. Oh, God. What am I doing?What?Hank!Are these your ants?From the ant farm?  Yes, Scott, they're my ants.How did you find them down here? I've been picking up strange signals ever since we crashed.First I thought maybe it was a malfunction.Some kind of interference.What is that?But it wasn't.It was the ants.They were reaching out the whole time.Apparently, they passed through some sort of time dilation.They've lived thousands of years in a single day... expanding their knowledge, their science...becoming more advanced than I could have ever thought.I didn't find them.They found me.I told you they were smart.They've already built something of a technocratic Class-Two civilization.I mean, I know socialism is a charged word...- --but we could learn a lot from these... -Dad. Yeah, they're my ants.And ants don't give up.I don't care who this guy is.I don't care what he can do.I'm getting Cassie.So, how do we even the odds against Kang?We've got some ideas.What are you thinking?Well, as a great writer once said...\"There's always room to grow.\"You read my book?Every goddamn word. Come on. Let's go to work.Hey! I'm sorry.That was probably terrifying.What are you doing here?I'm rescuing you.How?That's a good question.Does this thing have like a key? Or a card? Like a room key?Do you know, like a...Shit!Jump and tap.Jentorra. I'm sorry I got your people hurt.How can I help?Wow.Let's hurt 'em back. Damn, you're cool.Do you have a plan?Freeing you was basically my plan.Do you have a plan?We need to get a message out to anyone who can still fight.Then free our people from the detention cells below...and launch a counteroffensive from within.  Yeah, you have a plan. So, how do we get a message out?Follow me. Okay. Great. I built an empire down here, Janet.And I'm taking it with me.You really should've let me out when you had the chance.History is not written.It is forged.Today, we ascend. From this fortress, I will take my revenge on those who banished me.Today we conquer eternity.And the dynasty of Kang shall...Hello? Is this working?Cassie?I can't tell if this is working. Okay. I think we're on. I'll hold them off. Get the message out.I thought you were getting the message out.Now! We're inside. We breached the tower.And I'm with Jentorra.He's not invincible.I know it might feel like...it's too late...like all we do is just lose.But the family I've lost...taught me to keep fighting.And if they were here, they would too.We need to look out for the little guy.My dad taught me that.'Cause when people needed help...he didn't look the other way.And neither do we.We need to move!Come to the tower! Fight back! I know you've been waiting. Now is the time to strike.He knows he can't take all of us.Come to the...Cassie. I think I found the signal. Mom's gotta be there, too.- --Let's go. -I'll drive.Find Lang's daughter.Kill her.Let's go. Let's go!If you want to fight, follow me! It's over, Cassie. Free the others. Go!He's gonna see us coming. Yeah. I'll make sure of it.Begin the launch. Your dad's not here, Cassie...but I guess that's not a big surprise.Kang!We had a deal.You took my daughter!Holy shit.That's big.You lied to me!Our word is our bond.Without that, we're nothing!Bring him down.Yes, sir. Keep going. I've got them.Yeah, come on!There's so many!Scott! I can't hold them!They came. Way to go, Cassie!Yes!Come on! Let's go!Revolution!Burn it all down.Fight!Cover! Get down!What is the bridge code?I'll die first.One-eight-one-four-seven.Damn!You'll need this.Hi.This is our home!Let's take it back!No!I have holes.I have holes!I didn't know he could do that.Kang!Where is she?Launch now!What is that?He's getting out. Oh, no, he's not.Keep him away from the rings.Dad! Dad, I'm coming!Dad!Nowhere left to run.Please let this work. Hey, where do you think you're going?Let's go.You think this is over? Come on! Let's go. Darren, just stop...trying to be whatever this is.I don't know what to be.Tell me what to be. I don't know. Just don't be a dick.It's too late.Look at me.I'm such a dick.It's never too late to stop being a dick.We've gotta stop him.I have an idea.Ready?Probably not. One, two, three. Now!Dad!Dad!Cassie?You're huge.I'm huge. I love you, Peanut.I love you too.I'm so proud of you.I feel like I'm hugging Godzilla. I know. It feels so cool. I know, right?I'm so hungry. Yeah, that happens.- --I could eat everything. -Everything. I know.- --But I really want like a lime. -Right?-   --Citrus. It's weird. I know. -Citrus.It's...Take the tower!It's over.You still can't see it.It's never over.- --We have to go, right now. -No.- --Come on. -No! I know, I know, but we have to go.- --No! -Come on.You son of a...- --Oh, God. -Scott.Come on.You think this is new to me?Do you know how many rebellions I have put down?No, no, no.How many worlds I've conquered?How many Avengers I've killed?And you think you can beat me?I am Kang!You...You talk to ants.My name is Darren...and I am not a dick! Sorry I'm late.Lotta ants.Oh, is this you? You were right about me, Cassie.Darren.Are you okay?Probably not.- - -Darren? -Hi, Hope.You changed your hair.What the hell happened?Yeah. No... It's a whole thing. I'll tell you later.That was...I don't know what to say. Thanks, Scott.You always were a brother to me.I was?I was.And at least I died...an Avenger.Yeah.- --You did. -Yeah.You're in.A lot has happened today.- --Henry? -Janet?-  --Mom, where are you? -I'm in the tower.I think I can give us one shot back.But we don't have much time.If we wanna go home...we have to go now.We'll finish this.Thank you.Thank you.Come on! Let's go! All right. Good luck. Good luck. Come on. Thanks, buddy.You did it.Let's go home.Where's Scott?He was right behind me.You should've looked the other way.Yeah, well, never been great at that.And you're not getting out.I want you to remember.You could've gone home.You could've seen your daughter again.But you thought you could win.I don't have to win.We both just have to lose.Dad!Where... Where...Where is she? Is she...- --No, she's okay. -Where is she?She's okay. She's okay.-  --Scott, they're all okay. They're all okay. -She's safe?You did it.You did it.- --Sorry. Sorry, sorry. -No, no, no.No, don't let go. Don't let go.Don't let go.Don't ever let go.I got you.You came back. I love you, Hope. I love you, Scott.Let's go home.Home's good.My life doesn't make sense.I used to ask myself a lot of questions about that.\" \"\"Scott you just saved the Quantum Realm with your family...\"\"\"and drank a guy without holes.\"\"\"Why does this kind of stuff keep happening to you?\"\"\"That doesn't make any sense.\"But you know what?Who said life has to make sense?Rubin!You are the bug! I was wrong. Yeah. You are the other bug.You're the bug man.  You get big and get small like a big bug!   You're right. That's me. Just a coffee, please.12Twelve dollar.12Twelve!I used to wonder if this chapter in my life was over... \"\"but as Cassie reminded me, \"There's always someone you can help.\"Came out of cake making retirement for you. Wow.You made this yourself?- --Yeah! I don't usually make the cakes. -I know.1997This is the first one I've made since 1997.You're a real artist.It's been a pretty wild ride.One day you're fired from Baskin-Robbins...the next you're beating a time-traveling space king.We did beat him, right?I mean, yeah, that's what happened.He was getting out and he didn't get out.I think.But he also said something bad was coming... and that everyone would die if he didn't get out. Wait. So, did I just kill everyone?Is everyone gonna die because of me?Oh, my God.Oh my... What did I do?What did I do? You know what? It's probably fine.Like I said, life doesn't make any sense... so maybe stop asking so many questions, Scott.Stop overthinking it.Surprise!Happy Birthday to youIt's not my birthday. I know. But I missed a few. This is good. We're all together.You're fine.Everything's probably fine. Kang's gone. You did it.Don't have to worry about that guy anymore.Thanks. Happy fake birthday, Cassie.So, the exiled one is dead.You sure he's dead? If it wasn't true, I wouldn't call you. Must really eat you up, that you're not the one who killed him.None of us...killed him.They did.They're beginning to touch the Multiverse.And if we let them...they will take...everything...we've built.So let's stop wasting time.We're late.How many did you call?All of us. Luna ZhangTime is everything.It shapes our lives.But, perhaps, we can shape...it.It's him.What? You made him sound like this terrifying figure.He is.Please rate this subtitle at other users to choose the best subtitles\n"
